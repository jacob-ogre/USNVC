1	CONUS	1	1	01.A.3.D002M001E001	9238	South Florida Bayhead Swamp	"This system consists of predominately broad-leaved hardwoods emergent amidst marshes of the south Florida Everglades region. These areas are often called tree islands as they occur on slightly elevated sites above the low-relief marshes and have been considered ""perhaps the most striking botanical feature in the Everglades"" (Loveless 1959). Individual islands often have a characteristic shape depending upon the size; large islands are often teardrop-shaped, smaller islands are circular (Loveless 1959, Gunderson and Loftus 1993). Patches range in size from Â¼ acre to exceeding 300 or more acres. These islands often form an abrupt ecotone with adjacent fire-prone marshes. Fires enter bayhead swamps only under extreme drought conditions and may kill much of the bayhead vegetation and heavily reduce peat accumulation. If left long unburned, bayheads may succeed to hardwood hammocks."
1	CONUS	2	2	01.A.3.D002M001E002	9702	South Florida Cypress Dome	This system is found primarily in the Everglades and Big Cypress regions. This system consists of small forested wetlands in poorly drained depressions which are underlain by an impervious layer that impedes drainage and traps precipitation. They receive their common name from the unique dome-shaped appearance in which trees in the center are higher than those around the sides (Monk and Brown 1965). Pond-cypress is the dominant tree, with the oldest and largest individuals characteristically occupying the center, and smaller and younger individuals around the margins. Pools of stagnant, highly acid water may stand in the center of these depressions ranging from 1-4 feet in depth, but becoming increasingly shallow along the margins. The understory flora is typified by species with tropical affinities.
1	CONUS	3	3	01.A.3.D002M001E003	9305	South Florida Dwarf Cypress Savanna	The scrub or dwarf cypress system covers extensive areas of south Florida, especially in the Big Cypress Swamp region of southwest Florida. These stunted stands of pond-cypress grow on shallow sands or marl soils above limestone bedrock. Individual trees are usually quite small and widely scattered, with canopy coverage ranging from 30-45% (Flohrschutz 1978). The understory shares much overlap with wet prairies of the region (Drew and Schomer 1984) and is dominated by the following genera: beaksedge, flatsedge, muhly, and sawgrass. The open, stunted aspect is maintained in part by stresses imposed by extreme seasonal water level changes and low-nutrient soils (Anonymous 1978). Ewel (1990b) suggests a hydroperiod of approximately 6 months for this type.
1	CONUS	4	4	01.A.4.D004M005E004	9236	South Florida Mangrove Swamp	This swamp system occurs along intertidal and supratidal shorelines in southern Florida. The primary species comprising this system are red mangrove, black mangrove, white mangrove, and buttonwood, each with essentially tropical affinities and poor survival in cold temperatures. This system attains best development in low wave-energy, depositional environments. Examples occur on soils generally saturated with brackish water at all times and which become inundated during high tides. The brackish environment tends to limit competition from other species. Although at least three broad variants of this system can be recognized, i.e., riverine mangrove forests, fringe mangrove forests, and basin mangrove forests (Lugo et al. 1988), all are included here for now.
1	CONUS	5	5	01.B.1.D099M134E005	4132	South Florida Hardwood Hammock	This rockland tropical hammock system, as currently defined, occurs only in extreme southern Florida. It consists of upland hardwood forest on elevated ridges of limestone in three discrete major regions; the Keys, southeastern Big Cypress, and the Miami Rock Ridge. Tropical hardwood species are diagnostic of the system, although few are common or dominant in all regions where these hammocks occur (Snyder et al. 1990). Among the species likely to be encountered throughout are gumbo limbo, pigeon-plum, and white stopper. The northward ranges of these species are limited by the incidence of frosts (Drew and Schomer 1984). Diamondleaf oak is one of the few temperate species which attains prominence in this system. These forests tend to have a dense canopy that produces deeper shade, less evaporation, and lower air temperature than surrounding vegetation. This microclimate, in combination with high water tables, tends to keep humidity levels high and the community quite mesic (FNAI 1990). A number of orchid and bromeliad species thrive in such conditions. Unlike most coastal plain systems, fire is a major threat to ~South Florida Hardwood Hammock (CES411.287)$$. For this reason, many examples occur alongside natural firebreaks, such as the leeward side of exposed limestone (Robertson 1955), moats created by limestone solution (Duever et al. 1986), and elevated outcrops above marshes, scrub cypress, or sometimes mangrove swamps (Snyder et al. 1990).
1	CONUS	6	6	01.B.1.D099M134E006	4135	Southeast Florida Coastal Strand and Maritime Hammock	This ecological system occurs as a narrow band of hardwood forest and shrublands along the Atlantic coast of southeastern Florida (approximately Volusia County southward). It is found on stabilized, old, coastal dunes, often with substantial shell components. The vegetation is characterized by hardwood species with tropical affinities. As such, the northern extent of this type is limited by periodic freezes and cold tolerance of tropical constituent species, such as blolly and butter-bough (Johnson and Muller 1993a). This system is closely related to both inland tropical hammocks and southwest Florida maritime hammocks, and may share some species overlap with each.
1	CONUS	7	7	01.B.1.D099M134E007	4134	Southwest Florida Coastal Strand and Maritime Hammock	This ecological system occurs as a narrow band of hardwood forest lying just inland of the coastal dune system in southwestern Florida. It is found on stabilized, old, coastal dunes, often with substantial shell components. The vegetation is characterized by hardwood species with tropical affinities. As such, the northern extent of this type is limited by periodic freezes and cold tolerance of tropical constituent species, such as Jamaica-dogwood and white stopper (Johnson and Muller 1993a). This system is closely related to both inland tropical hammocks and southeast Florida maritime hammocks, and may share some species overlap with each.
1	CONUS	8	8	01.B.1.D099M296E008	4145	South Florida Pine Rockland	This system includes pinelands of extreme south Florida growing on limestone. The uniqueness of the flora associated with this type has long been recognized, including the number of endemic and West Indian species. It has been estimated that nearly one-third of the taxa found in this system are restricted to it, including half of south Florida's endemic plants (Stout and Marion 1993). Unlike pinelands elsewhere in the southeastern coastal plain, south florida slash pine is the only native pine species in this system. Understory vegetation consists of many hardwood species, including a number with tropical origins, and the herbaceous flora is species-rich and fire-adapted.

1	CONUS	11	11	01.C.1.D006M007E011	4536	Atlantic Coastal Plain Upland Longleaf Pine Woodland	This system of upland longleaf pine -dominated vegetation ranges from southern Virginia (beginning approximately at the James River) to northeastern Florida, and was perhaps the most extensive system in that area of the outer coastal plain. It is characterized by longleaf pine in an upland setting with natural exposure to frequent fire. A few occurrences just north of the range of longleaf pine are dominated by old-growth loblolly pine. It occurs on a variety of well- to excessively drained soils, and on the higher parts of upland-wetland mosaics. Most areas have an understory of scrub oaks. The herb layer is generally well-developed and dominated by three-awn and other grasses.  Frequent, low-intensity fire is the dominant natural ecological force.
1	CONUS	12	12	01.C.1.D006M007E012	5602	Atlantic Coastal Plain Xeric River Dune	This system encompasses a range of vegetation present on inland sand dunes of the Coastal Plain of Georgia. These dunes are associated with certain rivers such as the Ohoopee and Canoochee (Wharton 1978) and are apparently eolian in origin, formed of riverine alluvial sands. The sandy soils are deep, coarse, and xeric in nature. The vegetation consists of an assemblage of xeric communities that also occur in other xeric habitats in the Coastal Plain. These include longleaf pine - turkey oak communities and a scrub community akin to Inland Florida Scrub, but lacking sand pine. This system is distinguished from more typical xeric sandhills of the Coastal Plain by its occurrence on the deep sands of river dunes. In addition this environment is naturally topographically isolated and consequently has a lower fire-return interval than other upland systems of which longleaf pine is a component.

These stands occur inland of the coastal flatlands (sensu Peet and Allard 1993) and potentially occupy a much larger geographic area than this related system, extending landward into the Upper East Gulf Coastal Plain by about 50 miles. The characteristic species is Pinus palustris, although many stands may support only relictual individuals given a long history of exploitation and stand conversion. This system includes stands with a range of soil and moisture conditions. Mesic stands on fine-textured soils are more typical of the system, although limited xeric areas on deep sands are also present. In natural condition, fire is believed to have been frequent enough to limit development of intolerant species of hardwoods and both Pinus taeda and Pinus echinata. Although such species may be present or even common in the most mesic stands, they generally do not share dominance in the overstory unless the system has been fire-suppressed.

1	CONUS	17	17	01.C.1.D006M007E017	4321	West Gulf Coastal Plain Upland Longleaf Pine Forest and Woodland	The common and unifying feature of this system is vegetation naturally dominated by longleaf pine. This was formerly the most extensive system within its natural range in western Louisiana and eastern Texas. In most of the region, longleaf pine is (presently) a distinctive, but rarely dominant, element of existing vegetation (Harcombe et al. 1993). However, this tree historically dominated the vegetation across nearly all uplands regardless of soil type or moisture (excluding wetlands), and longleaf pine forests were among the most valuable economic resources in the region at the turn of the century (Bray 1906). Typical sites included sandhills on well-drained to excessively drained soils, but also more loamy and clayey upland soils. The importance of frequent fire has been well documented for the perpetuation of this system. Unlike comparable systems east of the Mississippi River, this type lies outside the range of threeawn spp. (wiregrasses), but most stands supported open grass-dominated understories rich in species diversity.
1	CONUS	18	18	01.C.1.D006M008E018	4210	Atlantic Coastal Plain Central Maritime Forest	This system encompasses most forests and shrublands of Atlantic Coast barrier islands and similar coastal strands, from Virginia Beach to central South Carolina. Areas are influenced by salt spray, extreme disturbance events, and the distinctive climate of the immediate coast. Many examples of this system will include a component of live oak or wax-myrtle. Also included are embedded freshwater depressional wetlands dominated by shrubs or small trees, such as  stiff dogwood, swamp bay, or Carolina willow.
1	CONUS	19	19	01.C.1.D006M008E019	4212	Atlantic Coastal Plain Southern Maritime Forest	This system encompasses a range of woody vegetation present on stabilized upland dunes of barrier islands and near-coastal strands, from central South Carolina (approximately Cooper River) southward to approximately Volusia County, Florida. It includes vegetation whose structure and composition are influenced by salt spray, extreme disturbance events, and the distinctive climate of the immediate coast. Examples are known from the barrier islands of Georgia and Florida, such as Big Talbot Island, Florida, and probably Sapelo Island, Georgia. Most typical stands are dominated by oaks, primarily live oak and/or sand live oak. Vegetation may also include different woodland communities often dominated by southern pine species. Longleaf pine, pond pine, and slash pine are all important in documented examples. These examples tend to have densely shrubby subcanopies and understories with species such as live oak, sand live oak, sand laurel oak, Chapman oak, myrtle oak, and southern magnolia. Unlike maritime vegetation to the north, this system may be more heavily influenced by natural fire regimes that may help to explain the predominance of the fire-tolerant pine species. It has been postulated that the natural fire frequency is from 20-30 years.
1	CONUS	20	20	01.C.1.D006M008E020	4136	Central and South Texas Coastal Fringe Forest and Woodland	This system includes oak-dominated forests woodlands, shrublands and savannas occurring on deep sands of the Pleistocene-aged Ingleside barrier-strandplain of the central Texas coast and the Holocene-aged eolian sand deposits of the South Texas Sand Sheet. Topography varies from larger dunes to smaller ridges and swales. Vegetation of this physiognomically variable and dynamic system primarily includes patches (mottes) of forests, woodlands and shrublands dominated by plateau live oak. Associated species vary in a north/south manner across the range of this system. Other canopy species in the vicinity of Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, at the northern end of the range, include blackjack oak, sand laurel oak, redbay, and sugarberry. In this area, understory species include yaupon, fringed greenbrier, mustang grape, and/or wax-myrtle. Other canopy species on the South Texas Sand Sheet, at the southern end of the range, include honey mesquite, Texas Hercules'-club, Brazilian bluewood, West Indian shrub-verbena, lotebush, and a very few other species. Many of the species found in the northern parts of the range of this system are absent in the southern occurrences. A characteristic component of the sparse ground cover within the mottes and forests across the entire range is Texas mallow. Canopy openings are similar in composition to surrounding grasslands. In addition to seaside bluestem, other herbaceous species common in canopy openings across the range of this system include brownseed crowngrass, gulfdune crowngrass, big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, hair-awn muhly, Georgia frostweed, sandhill croton, and plains snake-cotton. Minor changes in drainage can cause major differences in species composition. On the Ingleside barrier-strandplain, while gulfdune crowngrass may dominate slightly lower areas, deeper swales are typically dominated by switchgrass, saltmeadow cordgrass, fimbry spp., beach pennywort, beaksedge spp., umbrella-sedge spp., spikerush spp., and flatsedge spp.
1	CONUS	21	21	01.C.1.D006M008E021	4102	East Gulf Coastal Plain Limestone Forest	This system represents deciduous forests of the East Gulf Coastal Plain where limestone or other calcareous substrate occurs near enough to the surface to influence vegetation composition. Examples are most common in the Black Belt region of Alabama and Mississippi, but are also present in more isolated patches in other portions of the region, including western Alabama, northern Florida, and western Tennessee. Generally, the vegetation consists of forests and woodlands on well-developed, deep soils. Related vegetation surrounding rock outcrops and calcareous prairies is accommodated under other ecological systems.
1	CONUS	22	22	01.C.1.D006M008E022	4150	East Gulf Coastal Plain Maritime Forest	This system encompasses a mosaic of woody vegetation present on barrier islands and near-coastal strands along the northern Gulf of Mexico, from the Florida panhandle to southern Mississippi. Examples may include forests and/or shrublands that are found in somewhat more protected environments than ~East Gulf Coastal Plain Dune and Coastal Grassland (CES203.500)$$. Such areas include relatively stabilized coastal dunes, sometimes with a substantial shell component. Vegetation structure and composition are influenced by salt spray, extreme disturbance events, and the distinctive climate of the immediate coast. Stands may be dominated by a variety of needle-leaved and broad-leaved evergreen trees, including sand pine, slash pine, longleaf pine, live oak, cabbage palmetto, pignut hickory, and sand hickory. Wetland inclusions may be dominated by pond-cypress and sweetbay. The most heavily salt-influenced examples may appear pruned or sculpted.
1	CONUS	23	23	01.C.1.D006M008E023	4129	East Gulf Coastal Plain Southern Loess Bluff Forest	"This system of upland hardwood-dominated forests is defined as including both the steep loess bluffs bordering the eastern edge of the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain, ranging from south-central Mississippi to southeastern Louisiana, as well as hardwood vegetation of the ""Loess Plains"" immediately to the east of these bluffs and ravines. The vegetation is often richer than surrounding non-loessal areas, or those with only thin loess deposits. At least in some examples of this system, tree species normally associated with bottomland habitats are found to be abundant or even dominant in non-flooded uplands. In many cases, the bluffs provide habitat ""refugia"" for plant species that are more common to the north (Delcourt and Delcourt 1975). Braun (1950) noted that the general composition of forests along the bluffs changes from north to south; the more northerly examples are represented in this classification by ~East Gulf Coastal Plain Northern Loess Bluff Forest (CES203.481)$$, north of the range of southern magnolia and spruce pine. As currently defined this system ranges from about 32 degrees N latitude (where the Big Black River dissects the bluffs) southward and is restricted to the southern part of the Loess Bluff Hills (Ecoregion 74a of EPA (2004))."
1	CONUS	24	24	01.C.1.D006M008E024	4209	East Gulf Coastal Plain Southern Mesic Slope Forest	This forested system of the southern East Gulf and Atlantic coastal plains occurs on steep slopes, bluffs, or sheltered ravines where fire is naturally rare, generally within the natural range of spruce pine as mapped by Kossuth and Michael (1990) and southern magnolia as mapped by Outcalt (1990). Stands are mesic, and vegetation typically includes species such as American beech, southern magnolia, florida anisetree, and other species rarely encountered outside this system in the region. Related forests which occur on deep loess soils along the western margin of the region are classified as ~East Gulf Coastal Plain Southern Loess Bluff Forest (CES203.556)$$. Some component associations are also found in temporarily flooded floodplains adjacent to these slopes, but this is primarily an upland system. The system also includes essentially upland vegetation of Pleistocene terraces, although these are conceptually transitional to creek floodplain systems.
1	CONUS	25	25	01.C.1.D006M008E025	4153	Mississippi Delta Maritime Forest	This system includes forests on barrier islands and spits formed during the deltaic shifts of the Mississippi River. It also includes the woody vegetation of salt domes in the Mississippi River deltaic plain. Since natural deltaic processes have been altered, barrier island are no longer being formed in the Mississippi Delta region and existing barrier islands are undergoing subsidence and beach erosion. This system currently includes one forested beach ridge located at Grande Isle in Louisiana.
1	CONUS	26	26	01.C.1.D006M008E026	4130	Southern Coastal Plain Dry Upland Hardwood Forest	This is one of three hardwood-dominated systems found in the East Gulf Coastal Plain and adjacent areas of central Florida. This type is found in the Southern Coastal Plain and Southeastern Plains (EPA Level III Ecoregion 75 and parts of 65). Examples attributable to this type are typically deciduous or mixed evergreen oak-dominated forests, often with a pine component present. Although the southern portion of the range of this system overlaps ~Southern Coastal Plain Oak Dome and Hammock (CES203.494)$$, the latter is dominated by evergreen oak species, and the two should not be confused. The core range of this type extends northward to the approximate historical range of longleaf pine; although most deciduous species do not mimic this range, this boundary does appear to be a reasonable demarcation boundary north of which white oak becomes more abundant and south of which sand laurel oak is more diagnostic. Like all hardwood systems of this region, examples occur within a landscape matrix historically occupied by pine-dominated uplands and consequently only occurred in fire-sheltered locations in naturally small to large patches. Examples of this system tend to occur on sites intermediate in moisture tendency (mostly dry to dry-mesic), although occasional xeric stands may also be included. Toward the northern range limits of this system, it may have been less restricted to small patches in fire-protected locations, and may have been formerly more prevalent on the landscape even in areas heavily influenced by fire.<br><br>Important tree species vary geographically and according to previous disturbance. Sand laurel oak is a typical species in many examples, with post oak, southern red oak, and white oak less frequently encountered, but dominant in some stands. The overstory of some examples may be quite diverse, with hickories and other hardwood species often present. Typically mesic sites, as indicated by species indicative of these conditions, are covered under other systems. Loblolly pine is sometimes present, but it is unclear if it is a natural component or has entered only as a result of past cutting. Spruce pine or shortleaf pine may also be present in some examples. Stands may be found on slopes above rivers and adjacent to sinkholes, as well as other fire-infrequent habitats.
1	CONUS	27	27	01.C.1.D006M008E027	4146	Southern Coastal Plain Oak Dome and Hammock	This small-patch system occurs in the Southern Coastal Plain (Omernik ecoregion 75). Examples are known from inland portions of this region including parts of the East Gulf Coastal Plain (TNC ecoregion 53) and Florida peninsula (TNC ecoregion 55), and nearby portions of the South Atlantic Coastal Plain (TNC ecoregion 56). Thick stands of live oak and/or sand live oak are diagnostic of this system. Examples often occupy locally distinct microhabitats that differ from the surrounding landscape, such as shallow depressions or slight topographic highs in a predominantly longleaf pine-dominated landscape. Although embedded in a matrix of vegetation with extremely frequent fire regimes, patches of this system are subject to only infrequent or rare fire events. Under more frequent fire regimes, these sites would likely be occupied by longleaf pine. It has been postulated that winter burning regimes have allowed this type to expand. A range of soil and moisture conditions may be present. More mesic examples have relatively thin soils (to 50 cm) above clay, while xeric examples occupy deep (>130 cm) well-drained sands. Dominant plant taxa of mesic examples are live oak and sand laurel oak, along with eastern persimmon. Trumpetvine and greenbrier spp. dominate the sparse ground cover. In xeric examples, dominants include sand live oak, longleaf pine, live oak, Carolina wiregrass, and southern dawnflower. This system is low in plant species diversity compared to most other habitats in the region.
1	CONUS	28	28	01.C.1.D006M008E028	4137	West Gulf Coastal Plain Chenier and Upper Texas Coastal Fringe Forest and Woodland	This system includes a range of woody vegetation present along the northern Gulf of Mexico, from Louisiana to the upper Texas coast, including shell ridges along the coast and bay margins, coastal salt domes, stranded ancient barrier ridges (Ingleside barrier strandplain), and chenier ridges of the chenier plain. It is heterogeneous in physiognomy, including forests, woodlands and shrublands. The chenier plain is characterized by a prograding coastline replenished by sediments carried to the Gulf initially by the Mississippi and subsequently the Atchafalaya and other rivers. It is void of barrier islands and shoreline, sediments are reworked by waves into beach ridges, sometimes with a substantial shell component. This process has been continuing since the last glacial retreat, and as the coast line progrades, older beach ridges are left as interior ridges surrounded by marsh. These interior beach ridges are referred to as cheniers (French for oak) because they were historically dominated by live oak (live oak). Ridges parallel the coast and are usually 3 meters above mean sea level. Today, very few remain vegetated by a live oak-dominated forest because many have been cleared for agriculture. Though not confined to coastal areas, salt domes are a distinctive feature along the Gulf Coast of upper Texas and Louisiana where they often form a drastic contrast to the low-lying Coastal Plain sediments surrounding them. Formed by the rise of salt masses which push up overlying strata, salt domes may rise 30 meters above the surrounding landscape. The natural vegetation of cheniers and salt domes are oak-dominated woodlands and forests. The Ingleside barrier strandplain is a Pleistocene barrier ridge that outcrops discontinuously along the Texas coast. One of these areas is located northeast of Galveston Bay and supports vegetation classes within this ecological system. Shell ridges located along coast and bay margins are typically dominated by halophytic shrubs. Similar vegetation may also be found on coastal dredge spoil. Vegetation structure and composition of occurrences of this system may be influenced by salt spray (on those shell ridges, salt domes and cheniers closest to the Gulf), tropical storms and hurricanes, and the distinctive climate of the immediate coast. This system includes the Northern Gulf Coast Chenier Plain which extends from Vermillion Bay in Louisiana through Jefferson County, Texas; it also includes the upper Texas coast from the chenier plain south to Matagorda Bay.
1	CONUS	29	29	01.C.1.D006M008E029	4204	West Gulf Coastal Plain Mesic Hardwood Forest	This ecological system is found in limited upland areas (especially ravines and sideslopes) of the Gulf Coastal Plain west of the Mississippi River. These areas are topographically isolated from historically fire-prone, pine-dominated uplands in eastern Texas, western Louisiana, and southern Arkansas. Sites are often found along slopes above perennial streams in the region. These sites have moderate to high fertility and moisture retention. Soils can be quite variable, ranging from coarse to loamy in surface texture. Most are acidic in surface reactions and less commonly circumneutral. Vegetation indicators are mesic hardwoods such as American beech, white oak, and American holly, although scattered, large-diameter pines (most often loblolly pine) are also often present. Spring-blooming herbaceous species are typical in the understory of most examples.
1	CONUS	30	30	01.C.1.D006M157E030	4541	East-Central Texas Plains Pine Forest and Woodland	"This system, dominated by loblolly pine, is endemic to central Texas. Locally this is known as the ""Bastrop Pines."" Examples may share similarities, in terms of the vegetation, with Coastal Plain pine-hardwood systems to the east (TNC Ecoregions 40 and 41) but differ in the fact that this system contains only loblolly pine which is generally considered successional in the more eastern systems. The vegetation includes a range of communities (that have yet to be defined) that range from very dry to xeric uplands to dry and even mesic areas with different suites of hardwood associates. The loblolly pine of this region is genetically different than strains to the east; it has much greater drought tolerance. It is possible that this area was one of the epicenters of early southern pine colonization of the Coastal Plain based on fossil pollen evidence."
1	CONUS	31	31	01.C.1.D006M157E031	4332	West Gulf Coastal Plain Pine-Hardwood Forest	"This West Gulf Coastal Plain ecological system consists of forests and woodlands dominated by loblolly pine and/or shortleaf pine in combination with a host of dry to dry-mesic site hardwood species. This type was the historical matrix (dominant vegetation type) for large portions of TNC ecoregion 40 (Upper West Gulf Coastal Plain) where it replaced longleaf pine-dominated vegetation. In this region of southern Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana, and parts of eastern Texas, this type was historically present on nearly all uplands in the region except on the most edaphically limited sites (droughty sands, calcareous clays, and shallow soil barrens/rock outcrops). Such sites are underlain by loamy to fine-textured soils of variable depths. These are upland sites on ridgetops and adjacent side slopes, with moderate fertility and moisture retention. This type was also present in more limited areas of TNC ecoregion 41 (West Gulf Coastal Plain), where it was confined more typically to side slopes and other locations not dominated by longleaf pine. There are no known ""fidel"" herbaceous species or any local endemic or globally rare plant species, and overall this system may have supported relatively low levels of vascular plant species diversity. This system has undergone major transformations since European settlement of the region."
1	CONUS	32	32	01.C.1.D006M157E032	4336	West Gulf Coastal Plain Sandhill Oak and Shortleaf Pine Forest and Woodland	This ecological system occurs west of the Mississippi River primarily outside the natural range of longleaf pine and less commonly within. Like other sandhill systems of the Gulf and Atlantic coastal plains, this type is found on uplands underlain with deep, coarse sandy soils. These sites are typified by low fertility and moisture retention, which contribute to open tree canopies with usually <60% canopy closure. Sparse understory vegetation and abundant patches of bare soil are indicative of this system. Vegetation indicators are species tolerant of droughty sites, especially bluejack oak and Arkansas oak, but also blackjack oak and post oak. Longleaf pine is absent (or perhaps at low frequency within its range); shortleaf pine is usually present. This system supports a large concentration of vascular plant endemics, near endemics, and a number of plant species with high fidelity to sandhills in the region. Elsewhere in the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains, including most of the adjacent ecoregion (41), these site conditions are closely associated with longleaf pine.

It is the predominant system in its range, covering most of the natural landscape of the region.  It occurs on upland sites ranging from gently rolling, broad ridgetops to steeper side slopes, as well as locally in mesic swales and terraces.  Most soils are well- to excessively drained.  The vegetation is naturally dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris).  Most associations have an understory of scrub oaks.  The herb layer is generally well-developed and dominated by grasses.  Wiregrass (Aristida stricta in the north, Aristida beyrichiana in the south) dominates in most of the range, but other grasses dominate where it is absent.  Forbs, including many legumes, are also abundant.  Frequent, low-intensity fire is the dominant natural ecological force.

Valley oak is the characteristic oak  of these savannas, though other types may be present, including interior live oak, coast live oak, blue oak, California buckeye, Texas redbud, California juniper, and purple needlegrass. There is some evidence that much of the undergrowth prior to the invasion by non-native annual herbs was composed of native annual wildflowers such as tarweed, buckwheat, clover, gilia, pincushion-plant, lupine, western rosinweed, vinegar-weed, trefoil, wild carrot, and tarbush. There is considerable seasonal and annual variation in cover of undergrowth species due to timing of flowering and seasonal variation in precipitation and temperature. Today this majestic oak savanna is reduced in acreage by  agriculture and housing developments.

Highly localized endemic tree species include Monterey cypress, Gowen cypress, and Santa Cruz Island cypress in scattered groves along coastal Mendocino, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, and Monterey counties. Shore pine, lodgepole pine, bishop pine, Torrey pine, and Monterey pine are dominant or codominant in these and other occurrences. Pygmy woodland expressions where nutrient-poor sandstone soils underlies acidic sands (ancient marine terraces), and stunted and twisted shore pine stands along the Oregon coast (often called pygmy forests) are also part of this system. Shrubs include sensitive manzanita, Labrador-tea, evergreen blueberry, salal, California rhododendron, and Pacific bayberry. The lichen and moss component of this system is very diverse, includes cup lichen spp, and can be abundant in these communities.

Cover varies from nearly interlocking canopies with lush understory shrubs such as California blackberry, creeping snowberry, toyon, and poison-oak, to more open conditions with long-lived grasses.  More open stands typically occur on south-facing slopes.  Denser stands are often in areas with more moisture, such as north facing or at the bottom of a slope.  Past land use such as fire, fire suppression, livestock grazing, herbivory by feral pigs or other wildlife, can also affect stand structure.

A high-quality stands are open and park-like  foothill pine with  blue oak, interior live oak, coast live oak , valley oak, California buckeye, manzanita, redbud, buckbrush, California coffeeberry, oakwoods gooseberry, California juniper, and/or Coulter pine .  Foothill pine tends to drop out all together in the driest and more southerly sites, which are then  dominated by blue oak. Foothill pine density varies based on intensity or frequency of fire, being less abundant in areas of higher intensity or frequency fires, hence it is often more abundant on steep, rocky or more mesic north-facing slope exposures.

Coast live oak, interior live oak, Engelmann oak, and/or California walnut dominate a mixed closed or open canopy. Southern chaparral species such as common chamise, lemonade sumac, sugarbush, skunkbush, ceanothus spp., currant spp., and manzanita spp. are also characteristic. These woodlands may occur as remnant patches on offshore islands, where they include endemic species such as island oak and Catalina ironwood.  Most of these woodlands and savannas have been heavily altered through urban and agricultural development throughout southern California.

It is dominated by Madrean evergreen oaks such as Arizona white oak, Emory oak, gray oak, Mexican blue oak, and Toumey oak. Madrean pines, Arizona cypress, pinyon and juniper trees may be present, but are less abundant than oaks. Chaparral species including  Mexican manzanita, turbinella live oak, or sumac may be present.  Grasses are often prominent between trees in and may form an open woodland or grassland with scattered trees (savanna) that is dominated by warm-season grasses.

Soils are generally dry and rocky. The presence of Mexican pinyon, border pinyon, or other Madrean trees and shrubs is characteristic of this woodland. Redberry juniper, alligator juniper, Pinchot's juniper, one-seed juniper, and/or two-needle pinyon may be more  abundant. Madrean oaks such as Arizona white oak, Emory oak, or gray oak may be present, but less abundant than pinyon and juniper trees. Ponderosa pine is generally absent or sparse. Low shrubs and/or grasses may also be present.

Common trees are Arizona pine, apache pine, Chihuahuan pine, southwestern white pine, Arizona white oak, Emory oak, or gray oak intermingled with shrub patches on mid-elevation slopes (1500-2300 m elevation). Other tree species present may include Arizona cypress, alligator juniper, Mexican pinyon, ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir.  Chaparral shrubs such as Mexican manzanita, Wright's silktassel, and turbinella live oak are common under the pine-oak tree canopy.  Occasionally grasses are abundant.  Fires are frequent in these woodlands and forests.

The canopy is typically dominated by deciduous trees, including Buckley oak, Texas ash, or cedar elm. Plateau live oak and Ashe's juniper are often present but not dominant in this system. Canopy closure is variable, and this system can be expressed as forests and woodlands.
1	CONUS	51	51	01.C.1.D007M015E051	4152	Edwards Plateau Limestone Savanna and Woodland	This system occurs primarily on limestone soils in the Edwards Plateau and forms the is the most prevalent system within this area of Texas.  It can also occur on limestone in the shortgrass regions of Texas and north into Oklahoma. This system is typified by a mosaic of evergreen oak forests, woodlands and savannas over shallow soils of rolling uplands and upper slopes. Plateau live oak or Ashe's juniper are characteristic of this system. This system varies from dense patches of forest interspersed with grasslands to open savannalike woodlands with scattered individual or small groups of trees. Understories can contain various shrubs and grass species. Grasslands in this system tend to grade from shortgrass communities in the west to mixedgrass communities to the east. Substrate (limestone) determines the range of this system within given examples. Some disturbed areas of the western plateau are now dominated by mesquite woodland. Fire, grazing and browsing may also influence this system.
1	CONUS	52	52	01.C.1.D007M015E052	4208	Edwards Plateau Mesic Canyon	This system is largely endemic to the Edwards Plateau ecoregion and occurs on canyon bottoms, mesic lower slopes and steep canyons, primarily in the Southern Balcones Escarpment, but also in the Eastern Balcones Escarpment. This system also include areas of cliff faces and lower slopes of boxed canyons occurring as narrow, sometimes long bands in areas often with seeps where moisture is consistently more available than on adjacent slopes. The tree canopy is generally closed. Common components include cedar elm, Arizona walnut, Buckley oak, lacey oak, black cherry (becoming less common to the north), Texas ash (dominant in the northeastern plateau), chinquapin oak, and bigtooth maple. Canyon bottoms may have scattered bur oak. Substrate (limestone) and topographic position (north and east aspects and lower slopes) are the dominant characteristics of this system. Small seepage areas are often dominated by southern maidenhair, with Lindheimer's maidenfern on nearby moist habitats. Other prominent species include wand butterfly-bush, Mexican-buckeye, and eastern poison-ivy. Fire probably plays little role in the system, while grazing and browsing (by native as well as exotic ungulates) may play an important role in recruitment and understory composition. Adjacent, drier slopes are usually dominated by various oak species and Ashe's juniper.

The underlying granitic substrate determines the range of this system. It is comprised of a mosaic of vegetation types, including closed-canopy forests, open woodlands, savannas and sparsely vegetated rock outcrops. Common trees include blackjack oak, plateau live oak, post oak, black hickory, cedar elm, and honey mesquite. Subcanopy species may include Texas persimmon, whitebrush, Mexican-buckeye, lotebush, Texas kidneywood, Ohio buckeye, Texas prickly-pear, soaptree yucca, Texas bear-grass, and Christmas cholla. Grasslands may be dominated by little bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, switchgrass, hairy grama, sideoats grama, Texas needlegrass, silver beardgrass, and Wright's plantain. Granitic glades and barrens are sparsely vegetated by crustose and foliose lichens, several ferns and fern allies, and cacti. This system also includes small (up to 16 m in diameter) shallow depressions that hold rainwater and support wetland flora including the Texas endemic, rock quillwort.

Elevations range from 460 to 1920 m. Most occurrences of this system are dominated by a mix of Oregon white oak and ponderosa pine or Douglas-fir. Isolated, taller ponderosa pine or Douglas-fir over Oregon white oak trees characterize parts of this system. The understory may include dense stands of shrubs or, more often, be dominated by grasses, sedges or wildflowers.  Shrub layers may including antelope bitterbrush, basin big sagebrush, black sagebrush, and green rabbitbrush. Understories are generally dominated by herbaceous species, especially grasses. Mesic sites have an open to closed sod-forming grasses and grass-like plants such as pinegrass, Geyer's sedge, Ross' sedge, long-stolon sedge, or blue wild rye.
1	CONUS	55	55	01.C.1.D007M019E055	4320	Mediterranean California Mixed Evergreen Forest	This ecological system occurs from the Santa Cruz Mountains, California, north into southwestern Oregon throughout the outer and middle Coast Ranges. It occurs just inland of the redwood belt . It also occurs in southern California in more mesic, protected, cooler sites of the Transverse and Peninsular ranges. Characteristic trees include Douglas-fir, canyon live oak, tanoak, Pacific madrone, California laurel, and golden chinkapin. On the eastern fringe of this system, in the western Siskiyous, other conifers occur such as ponderosa pine and Port Orford-cedar. In southern California (Transverse and Peninsular ranges), bigcone Douglas-fir replaces Douglas-fir but co-occurs with canyon live oak and sometimes coast live oak. Incense-cedar is occasional. In the southern portion of the range, tanoak, Pacific madrone, California laurel, and golden chinkapin become less important or are absent. Historic fire frequency was higher than for redwood forests, occuring (every 50-100 years).
1	CONUS	56	56	01.C.1.D007M019E056	4144	Mediterranean California Mixed Oak Woodland	Mixed oak woodlands from southwestern Oregon and southwestern Oregon, with Oregon white oak and California black oak.  Occasionally other hardwoods, including Canyon live oak or madrone can be important, but conifers are not as important or common in this hardwood forest and woodland system.  The understory in good condition areas are usually native perennial grass or deciduous shrubs (poison oak or snowberry), but introduced annual grasses have become dominant in most stands.  Chapparal shrubs such as buckbrush or sticky manzanita are often present as well.
1	CONUS	57	57	01.C.1.D007M019E057	4319	North Pacific Dry Douglas-fir-(Madrone) Forest and Woodland	This system is most common in the Puget Trough - Willamette Valley ecoregion but also occurs in adjacent ecoregions.  These woodlands are fairly dry conifer forests dominated by Douglas fir, often with madrone or Oregon white oak, but rarely with other conifers present.  Historically this was a widespread, fire maintained type, which has moved to occupy areas that were formerly prairies and oak savannas.  These sites are too dry and warm or have been too frequently and extensively burned to have more than small amounts of western hemlock or western red-cedar. Pacific madrone is favored by high-severity fires on sites where it occurs, and Douglas-fir can be locally eliminated by logging and hot fire or repeated high-severity fires. Incense-cedar is absent.
1	CONUS	58	58	01.C.1.D007M019E058	4110	North Pacific Oak Woodland	This ecological system is limited to the southern portions of the North Pacific region. It occurs primarily in the Puget Trough and Willamette Valley but trickles down into the Klamath ecoregion and into California.  The woodlands and forests are dominated by Oregon white oak, and are found on dry, predominantly low-elevation sites and/or sites that experienced frequent presettlement fires.  Many places are being invaded by Douglas-fir or other conifers with fire suppression.  Pacific madrone is also not uncommon.  Plant life under the tree canopy was historically composed of native grasses but are now  mostly composed of  non-native (introduced from other continents) grasses, as well as  poison oak, snowberry or ferns.
1	CONUS	59	59	01.C.1.D060M158E059	5811	Edwards Plateau Limestone Shrubland	This system occurs as a matrix on relatively thin-soiled surfaces of plateaus of the massive limestones such as the Edwards limestone. These short to tall shrublands are variable in density depending on amount of bedrock. White shin oak is an important component of the system, with some areas dominated by plateau live oak. Ashe's juniper is often an important component of this system. Other species may include evergreen sumac, prairie sumac, Texas redbud, wild privet, Texas ash, Mexican-buckeye, mescalbean, Texas persimmon, and agarito. This system also includes Mohr shin oak-dominated shrublands that are more common in the southern shortgrass prairie northwest of the Edwards Plateau, often sharing dominance with Pinchot's juniper. Disturbances such as fire may be important processes maintaining this system. However, it appears to persist on most thin-soiled sites.

These forests are typically dominated by white oak, southern red oak, chestnut oak, scarlet oak, and black oak, with lesser amounts of red maple, pignut hickory, mockernut hickory, and sometimes sprouts of American chestnut. Scattered and small inclusions of  pine may occur, particularly adjacent to escarpments or following fire (shortleaf and Virginia pine, or white pine in the absence of fire). It occurs in a variety of situations, including on nutrient-poor or acidic soils.

These high-elevation deciduous forests occur on exposed sites mostly between 3000-4500 feet elevation. The weathered soils are thin, nutrient-poor, low in organic matter, and acidic. The forests are dominated by red oak and white oak, with the individuals often stunted or wind-flagged.  Chestnut sprouts are also common, but the importance of chestnut in these forests has been dramatically altered by chestnut blight. Mountain holly and early azalea are characteristic shrubs.

Included are classic northern hardwood forests as well as high-elevation oak forests.  Thus, examples may be dominated by Quercus rubra or various combinations of mesophytic hardwoods.  High-elevation climate is the most important ecological factor.  Included in this system are limited areas locally known as ""beech gaps"" and ""boulderfields."
1	CONUS	64	64	01.C.2.D008M012E064	4330	Central Appalachian Oak and Pine Forest	These forests cover large areas in the central Appalachians and northern Piedmont, north to central New England. The setting ranges from rolling hills to steep slopes, with occasional occurrences on more level topography. The soils are coarse and infertile; they may be deep (on glacial deposits in the northern part of the range), or shallow, on rocky slopes of acidic rock. The well-drained soils and exposure create dry conditions. The forest is mostly closed-canopy but can include patches of more open woodlands. It is dominated by a variable mixture of dry-site oak and pine species such as chestnut oak, white oak, red oak, black oak, scarlet oak, pitch pine, and white pine; these may occur as oak forest, mixed oak-pine forest, or patches of pine forest. Heath shrubs (hillside blueberry, huckleberry, and  mountain laurel, etc.), often dense, are characteristic. Disturbance agents include fire, windthrow, and ice damage. Increased site disturbance generally leads to secondary forest vegetation with a greater proportion of pine and weedy hardwoods such as red maple. In the absence of fire, this system is believed to develop into northern hardwood and hemlock forests.
1	CONUS	65	65	01.C.2.D008M012E065	4118	Crosstimbers Oak Forest and Woodland	Crosstimbers woodlands and forests are primarily found within central Texas and Oklahoma, ranging north to southeastern Kansas, and east into eastern Oklahoma.  They are common in large areas within their range.  The area consists of rolling plains with primarily sandy to loamy soils. Rainfall can be moderate, but somewhat erratic, therefore water is often lacking for the plants during part of the growing season. These forests and woodlands are characterized by open woodlands or closed forests dominated by short, stunted post oak and blackjack oak.  Other species, such as black hickory, bitternut hickory, dwarf chinquapin oak, cedar elm, and oak can also be present. The understory often contains species typical of the surrounding prairies, in particular little bluestem. Shrubs such as sumac may also be present. Drought, grazing, and fire are the primary disturbances affecting these forests and woodlands and help maintain their characteristic species.

It occurs over relatively deep soils (as opposed to ""glades and barrens""), with circumneutral surface soil pH.  However, like other Mississippi Embayment Prairie systems, this type occurs in a matrix of acid soils, and generally forested vegetation. In most cases individual prairie openings are small and isolated from one another, but were formerly more extensive prior to European settlement forming a mosaic of grassland and woodlands under frequent fire regimes. Much of the natural vegetation of the region has been converted to pasture and agricultural uses, but even old-field vegetation reflects the distinctive composition of the flora and ecological dynamics. The flora has much in common with other prairies of the Mississippi Embayment as well as the classic Midwestern prairies.

1	CONUS	67	67	01.C.2.D008M012E067	4117	East Gulf Coastal Plain Northern Dry Upland Hardwood Forest	This system represents dry, upland, predominantly hardwood forests of limited portions of the Coastal Plain of western Kentucky and Tennessee, northern Mississippi and Alabama. The core range of this type lies within the Northern Hilly Coastal Plain (Level IV Ecoregion 65e) of Omernik (EPA 2004), which includes the Northern Pontotoc Ridge (222Cf), Upper Loam Hills (222Cg), and Northern Loessal Hills (222Ce) subsections of Keys et al. (1995). These areas occupy the eastern margin of the upper Coastal Plain where elevation is greatest and influence of loess is less than adjacent areas to the west. The vegetation has been broadly considered distinct from other Coastal Plain forests (Bryant et al. 1993, Fralish and Franklin 2002) but has received almost no specific study. Although vastly forested when compared to the loess plains to the west (USGS 1992), most of the vegetation is recovering from one or more forms of severe disturbance (Franklin and Kupfer 2000). White oak dominates the upland forests which have been studied in a limited portion of this area (Franklin and Kupfer 2000), but communities have not been described to the same detail as in other ecological systems.

1	CONUS	70	70	01.C.2.D008M012E070	4140	East-Central Texas Plains Post Oak Savanna and Woodland	"This system is primarily found within eastern Texas, lying in a broad band west of the Upper West Gulf Coastal Plain and Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes ecoregions, ranging from Live Oak and Atascosa counties in the south and trending in a northeasterly band to the Red River along the Oklahoma-Texas border. It exhibits some floristic and physiognomic variation across this northeast-southwest gradient. Its range is roughly co-incident with (parts of) the ""East Central Texas Plains"" (Level III Ecoregion 33) of EPA (Griffith et al. 2004). It is distinguished from the surrounding prairie by the higher density of trees and diversity of woody species. The system differs from the floristically similar ~Crosstimbers Oak Forest and Woodland (CES205.682)$$ in that it generally occurs on Tertiary (primarily Eocene) geologic formations on the East-Central Texas Plains, while the related Crosstimbers ecological system occupies Cretaceous and older formations of the interior plains (EPA Level III Ecoregion 29). Floristically, Post Oak Savanna (at least north of the Colorado River) contains species of more eastern affinities such as beautyberry, sassafras, flowering dogwood, farkleberry, winged elm, and particularly yaupon, the latter species being absent from ~Crosstimbers Oak Forest and Woodland (CES205.682)$$. Post Oak Savanna generally occurs on sandy or loamy soils, often underlain by a claypan subsoil. Rainfall ranges from about 120 cm in the northeastern part of the range to about 70 cm in the southwest, where it becomes increasingly erratic. Therefore moisture is often limiting during part of the growing season. The system was historically characterized as having significant areas of graminoid cover with species composition resembling that of nearby prairie systems, punctuated by short, stunted woodlands and forests dominated by post oak and blackjack oak. Other species, such as black hickory, bluejack oak (on more xeric sites), plateau live oak, winged elm, eastern red-cedar, and honey mesquite, can also be present. In some sites, particularly in the south, plateau live oak may codominate the woodlands. Shrubs may attain significant cover in the understory, with species including yaupon (often dominant), beautyberry, farkleberry, gum bumelia, possum-haw, eastern poison-ivy, and coralberry. Where light penetration allows the development of an herbaceous understory or in areas with reduced woody canopy, the understory contains species typical of the surrounding prairies, in particular little bluestem, but also including big bluestem, silver beardgrass, brownseed crowngrass (to the south), yellow Indiangrass, and sand dropseed. Drought, grazing, and fire are the primary natural processes that affect this system. Much of this system has been impacted by conversion to improved pasture or crop production. Overgrazing and fire suppression have led to increased woody cover on most extant occurrences and the invasion of some areas by problematic brush species such as eastern red-cedar and honey mesquite in the southern part of the system's range. These factors have also led to decreases in native grass cover allowing for annual grasses and forbs to invade."

These Pleistocene dunes were overlooked or unrecognized until the late 1970s (Saucier 1978). This fact coupled with long periods of weathering and human disturbance, as well as proximity to a terrace mapped as ""prairie"" in General Land Office records, has led to considerable confusion regarding this type (T. Foti pers. comm.). These dunes are west of Crowley's Ridge and near the Black and White rivers, above the normal flood level of the Mississippi. Examples in Missouri occur amidst a series of low-lying, anastomosing channels that have helped to protect them from extensive alteration more typical in Arkansas where the uplands have been largely cleared. The uppermost portions of the dunes support a xeric community similar to sandhills of the West Gulf Coastal Plain (WGCP), but are outside the natural range of bluejack oak, a diagnostic species typical of the WGCP examples. Instead the dunes support very open post oak woodlands with little bluestem and abundant lichen cover (presumably cup lichen spp.), along with pricklypear sp. Less edaphically extreme slopes support more closed-canopied forests in which post oak is still important, along with southern red oak and possibly other species. In many instances, distinctive wetlands imbedded within this system are also present (~Lower Mississippi River Dune Pond (CES203.189)$$). Called ""sand ponds"" in Arkansas, these depressions have silty bottoms and perched water tables. The margin of these ponds are rimmed by willow oak and have overcup oak (Heineke 1987)."

The vegetation is very distinctive from that of the adjacent alluvial plain, and the sites themselves, which occur on distinct slopes that rise above the alluvial plain surface, also contrast sharply with it. Occurrences of this system generally comprise dry-mesic forests that occupy west-facing slopes and narrow, ""finger"" ridgetops in a highly dissected landscape. In many cases, these slopes provide habitat for plant species that are uncommon in other parts of the alluvial plain.

They are common and can occur within larger prairie landscapes or adjacent to oak savannas and richer oak forests.  Soils are well drained sand or sandy loam.  Trees form a moderately closed to closed canopy, with canopy closure increasing with time since fire.  Fire-resistant oak species, in particular black oak, bur oak, scarlet oak, and northern pin oak, dominate the overstory. The understory may include shrubs and/or a mixture of woodland and grassland species, including little bluestem, wavy hairgrass, and Pennsylvania sedge. Extreme drought, along with periodic ground and canopy fires maintain the more open canopy structure that supports oak regeneration.  It is found primarily within the ""corn belt"" of the United States, and remaining large areas of this system are likely under considerable pressure due to conversion to pastureland and urban development."

They can occur on uplands within a prairie landscape and near floodplains, or on rolling glacial moraines.  Forest cover can range from a dense to moderately open canopy and there is commonly a dense shrub layer.  Fire-resistant oak species, in particular bur oak, northern red oak, and/or white oak, dominate the overstory. Hickories, including shagbark hickory, bitternut hickory, and mockernut hickory, are important in portions of the range of this system. Depending on site location and overstory canopy density, the understory may include species such as American hazelnut, serviceberry, and a wide variety of wildflowers. Fire maintained the more open canopy structure that allowed oak regeneration necessary to sustain this forest.  Continued fire suppression has also resulted in succession to mesic hardwoods.  Extensive conversion for agriculture has fragmented this system.

This vegetation is very distinctive from that of the adjacent alluvial plain, and the ridge itself also contrasts sharply with the adjacent alluvial plain. Crowley's Ridge is a remnant loess-capped feature rising from 30 m to over 60 m (100-200 feet) above the alluvial plain surface, to about 150 m (450 feet) above sea level. The base of the northern ridge is comprised of Tertiary substrates overlain by alluvial deposits and capped with generally thin layers of Pleistocene loess. The Pleistocene alluvial deposits are often sandy, and in a very limited area, there are outcrops of sandstone of uncertain origin. Forests on the ridgetops are dominated by shortleaf pine with varying amounts of white oak, northern red oak, southern red oak, post oak, black hickory, and black oak. Loess slopes and ravines are dominated by mesic or dry-mesic hardwood forests such as those of the southern ridge, but are of relatively limited extent.

This is the upland forest that characterizes much of the lower elevations of these areas. Substrates can range from acidic to circumneutral or basic, and the vegetation varies accordingly. Bedrock may be of any type. Soils are usually deep residual soils but are often rocky. Typically, the vegetation consists of forests dominated by oaks, especially chestnut oak, white oak, red oak, black oak, and scarlet oak, with varying amounts of  hickory, black gum, and red maple. Historically, chestnut was a dominant or codominant in many of these communities until its virtual elimination by the chestnut blight fungus during the early 1900s. Some areas (usually on drier sites) now have dense evergreen ericaceous shrub layers of mountain laurel, with great rhododendron on more mesic sites. Some other areas have deciduous heath layers of blueberry and/or huckleberry.  This system concept also includes many successional communities that have been impacted by logging or agriculture, such as types dominated by tuliptree, pine, and black locust. This system is naturally dominated by stable, uneven-aged forests, with canopy dynamics dominated by gap-phase regeneration. Most oaks are long-lived with typical age of mortality ranging from 200 to 400 years. Scarlet and black oaks are shorter lived with typical ages being approximately 50 to 100 years, while white oaks can live as long as 600 years.

The floristic expression of different stands included in this system varies considerably with aspect and soil type. Included here are a variety of associations ranging along a moisture gradient from submesic to drier ones. The submesic to dry-mesic expressions tend to be found on midslopes with northerly to easterly aspects, and the drier ones on southerly to westerly aspects and on broad ridges. Parent material can range from calcareous to acidic with very shallow, well- to excessively well-drained soils in the drier expressions and moderately well-drained soils in the submesic to dry-mesic ones. The canopy closure of this system ranges from closed to somewhat open in the drier examples. Historically, these examples may have been more open under conditions of more frequent fire.<br><br>A number of different oak species may dominate stands of this system, with hickory species also prominent. In the drier examples, chestnut oak is typical over most of the range, reflecting relations with other Appalachian systems to the east. In addition, post oak, blackjack oak, and scarlet oak will also share dominance or be prominent in many of the drier examples. Chinquapin oak and/or Shumard oak may appear in drier examples with high base status. White oak may also be present but not typically dominant. In the submesic to dry-mesic examples, white oak will typically exhibit dominance, possibly with black oak or southern red oak. The understories are typically shrub- and small tree-dominated, with the typical species varying with aspect, soil, and moisture relations.

Northern hardwoods such as sugar maple, yellow birch, and beech are characteristic, either forming a deciduous canopy or mixed with hemlock (or in some cases  white pine). Other common and sometimes dominant trees include red oak, tuliptree, black cherry, and black birch. It is of more limited extent and more ecologically constrained in the southern part of its range.  Fire suppression appears to have increased the extent of this system.

Forests are generally dominated by red spruce, Fraser fir, or a mixture of the two.  Examples occur as low as 3200 feet at the northern range in West Virginia, and may range up to the highest peaks. Elevation and orographic effects make the climate cool and wet, with heavy moisture input from fog as well as high rainfall. Strong winds, extreme cold, rime ice, and other extreme weather are periodically important.

1	CONUS	98	98	01.C.2.D008M014E098	4113	Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods Forest	These hardwood forests are one of the major ecological systems across New England and adjacent Canada west to Minnesota. They occur in various upland settings at low to moderate elevations (generally <2000â) across the glaciated landscape.  Sugar maple,  yellow birch, and beech are the dominant trees (the latter only east of northern Wisconsin); hemlock and (east of the Great Lakes) red spruce are frequent but minor canopy associates.  Paper birch, aspen, and red maple, along with white pine,  are common in successional stands.  This system can include large expanses of species-rich forest in areas of limestone or similar bedrock, as well as forests that are relatively species-poor in areas of granitic (or similar) bedrock or acidic till. Blowdowns or snow and ice loading, with subsequent gap regeneration, are the most frequent form of natural disturbance.

Soils are loamy to sandy, varying from thin soil over bedrock to deeper soils, sometimes sandy. These dry forests usually have a closed canopy but are sometimes open.  Red pine is a characteristic species though it is not always dominant.  Eastern white pine occurs frequently and typifies some areas.  Boreal conifers may occasionally be present. Conifers typically characterize the canopy, but other common tree species may include hardwoods such as red oak or red maple, as well as aspen or paper birch.  The latter are particularly common after large disturbances such as major fires, windstorms, or logging.  The shrub layer can vary from sparse to fairly dense.  Blueberries and hazel are typical species.  Fires occurring every 100-200 years maintain the pine-dominated nature of this forest.

The forests usually occur on low-nutrient soils at low elevations, mostly less than 2000â.  Soils vary from somewhat dry to somewhat moist, but are usually not extremely dry. White pine, hemlock, and red oak are typical canopy dominants; beech is a common associate in some areas.  Red maple (or black birch at the southern periphery of the range) is also common.  (Oaks besides red oak are essentially absent from this system, being more representative of systems to the south.)  Gap replacement from treefalls, and infrequent fire, are the primary natural regeneration modes.

This region was not glaciated like the surrounding areas and thus is predominated by rolling hills and bluff outcrops.  This system is found primarily on blufftops and dry upper slopes along the Upper Mississippi River, although it can range into bordering regions such as the Baraboo Hills in Wisconsin.  This system contains a mosaic of woodlands, savannas, prairies and sparsely vegetated limestone, dolomite, and/or sandstone outcrops, with occasional talus, especially algific talus.  Woodlands consist of primarily a mixture of oak species. Sugar maple, yellow birch, pines and eastern hemlock may occur on more protected areas.  Prairie openings contain little bluestem and sideoats grama.  Historically, fire was the most important dynamic maintaining these systems, however, fire suppression within the region has allowed more canopy cover and very few prairie openings remain.  Algific talus harbors a number of unusual Pleistocene relict species, including plants and snails.

It occurs in areas  somewhat protected from most natural fires by some combination of steeper topography, isolation from the spread of fire, and limited flammability of the vegetation. If fires were more frequent, the vegetation would likely be replaced by more fire-tolerant southern pines, especially longleaf pine.

It is the predominant system in its range, covering most of the natural landscape of the region.  It occurs on upland sites ranging from gently rolling, broad ridgetops to steeper side slopes, as well as locally in mesic swales and terraces.  Most soils are well- to excessively drained.  The vegetation is naturally dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris).  Most associations have an understory of scrub oaks.  The herb layer is generally well-developed and dominated by grasses.  Wiregrass (Aristida stricta in the north, Aristida beyrichiana in the south) dominates in most of the range, but other grasses dominate where it is absent.  Forbs, including many legumes, are also abundant.  Frequent, low-intensity fire is the dominant natural ecological force.

Stands occur on generally well-drained sandy or clayey soils and are dry to dry-mesic in moisture; both xeric and mesic areas are excluded.  Pinus echinata is the dominant pine species of the generalized ""dry and dry-mesic oak-pine"" forest type in the Gulf Coastal Plain (White and Lloyd 1998) and is the most characteristic floristic component of this system.  The actual amount of Pinus echinata present varies based on a number of factors, but intact examples of this system often include stands that are dominated by Pinus echinata grading into stands with a mixture of upland hardwoods.  Locally, on mid to lower slopes, Pinus taeda may be a component, extending further upslope in the absence of fire.  Fire is possibly the most important natural process affecting the floristic composition and vegetation structure of this system, although fire-return intervals are lower than those associated with the East Gulf Coastal Plain Interior Upland Longleaf Pine Woodland (CES203.496).  Pinus echinata may have difficulty replacing itself in the absence of fire, particularly on sites other than the driest ones (Eyre 1980).  Landers (1989) inferred a fire-return interval of 10 times per century for Pinus echinata.  Local topographic conditions affecting natural fire compartment size generally lend themselves to this fire frequency, although some examples may have more frequent fires and some less than this generalized value.  Where fire is most frequent the system may develop a relatively pure canopy of Pinus echinata typified by a very open woodland structure with scattered overstory trees and an herbaceous-dominated understory; such examples are rare on the modern landscape.  More typical are areas in which Quercus spp., Carya spp., Liquidambar styraciflua, Liriodendron tulipifera, Acer spp., and Nyssa sylvatica have become prominent in the midstory and even overstory and in which herbaceous patches are rare.

Although examples of this system occur throughout this region, there is local variation in the extent to which they were present. For example, this system was historically prominent in the Ozark Highlands where sandstone derived soils were common, being excluded from or diminished in other areas by inadequate winter precipitation and non-conducive soils. In Missouri and Oklahoma, this system occurs on gently dissected upland cherty plains (in addition to sandstone ridges). The center of distribution would be the northern and western Ouachita Mountains. In the Ouachitas, the system occurs on the northern Hogback Ridges excluding the Novaculite areas to the south. In nearly all cases, shortleaf pine occurs with a variable mixture of hardwood species. The exact composition of the hardwoods is much more closely related to aspect and topographic factors than is the pine component.

Although examples of this system occur throughout this region, there is local variation in the extent to which they were present. For example, this system was historically prominent only in the southeastern part of the Ozark Highlands where sandstone derived soils were common, being excluded from or diminished in other areas by inadequate winter precipitation and non-conducive soils. In contrast, pine was virtually ubiquitous in the historical forests of the Ouachitas. In nearly all cases (at least in the Ouachitas), shortleaf pine occurs with a variable mixture of hardwood species. The exact composition of the hardwoods is much more closely related to aspect and topographic factors than is the pine component.

The heavily ericaceous-dominated understories (especially Kalmia latifolia and Gaylussacia baccata) help to distinguish this system from Southern Piedmont Dry Oak-(Pine) Forest (CES202.339).  Elsewhere in the southern Piedmont these species are largely confined to mountainous regions and monadnocks of the inner Piedmont.

These areas are flat and usually have failry rich soils ranging from loamy to gravelly in texture. Aspen parklands include a mosaic of tallgrass prairie, wet prairie, brush prairie, and aspen-oak woodlands. They are characterized by quaking aspen with scattered bur oak and paper birch. Shrubs such as willow and hazel are also common. The most prevalent tallgrass species is big bluestem, which is often associated with yellow Indiangrass, reedgrass, and prairie dropseed. Fire is the most important natural process that helps maintain the open parkland or brushy nature of this system. Wind and grazing are also important processes. Conversion to agriculture and fire suppression have decreased the range of this system and allowed more shrubs and trees to establish.

The climate in this region is mostly subhumid low boreal with short, warm summers and cold, long winters. Much of this region is covered with undulating to kettled glacial till. Quaking aspen characterizes this system. Common associates are paper birch and balsam poplar with an understory of mixedgrass species and tall shrubs. More poorly drained sites may contain willow and sedges. Fire constitutes the most important dynamic in this system and prevents boreal conifer species such white spruce and balsam fir from becoming too established in this system.

These sites are typically moister than most of the surrounding area. This system is composed largely of tall, deciduous shrubs occuring along upper terrances, gentle slopes near breaks, and toeslopes, often in upper terraces or near rivers and streams.  It usually is composed of one or more shrubs with grasses such as junegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, thread-leaf sedge and fescue.  It is similar to midgrass prairie systems, but can be easily distinguised by the presence of at least 10% cover of shrubs assuming that little to no fire suppression has occurred.  Fire and grazing constitute the primary dynamics affecting this system.  Drought can also impact this system.

It is dominated by bur oak with a sparse to moderate cover of prairie grasses or woodland sedges. Shrubs such as choke cherry, beaked hazelnut, snowberry, or Saskatoon serviceberry can occur. Historically, higher cover of grass species occurred as these stands were more open due to more frequent fires. Grazing, conversion to agriculture, and past timber harvesting also can impact this system. Overgrazing can also lead to a decrease in understory species, and timber harvesting can completely eliminate examples of this system.  Few good examples of this system likely remain because of these disturbances.

It may occur on steep northern slopes or within canyon bottoms that do not experience periodic flooding, although soil moisture and topography allow greater than normal moisture conditions compared to the surrounding areas. Occurrences can be either tree-dominated or predominantly shrubland. Ash and elm tress typically characterize this system. Fire can influence this system; however, grazing is the most prevalent dynamic process influencing this system. This system was often subjected to heavy grazing and trampling by both domestic animals and wildlife and can be heavily degraded in some areas.

Such sites include lower slopes and bluffs along streams and rivers in dissected terrain, mesic flats between drier pine-dominated uplands and floodplains, and local raised areas within bottomland terraces or wet flats. Soils are variable in both texture and pH. The vegetation consists of forests dominated by trees that include a significant component of mesophytic deciduous hardwood species, such as beech or southern sugar maple. Upland and bottomland oaks at the mid range of moisture tolerance are usually also present, particularly white oak, but sometimes also southern red oak, cherrybark oak, or Shumard oak. Loblolly pine is sometimes present, but it is unclear if it is a natural component or has entered only as a result of past cutting. Understories are usually well-developed. Shrub and herb layers may be sparse or moderately dense.

The geology is typically mapped as the Jackson Formation. These bluffs extend up to 150 m (500 feet) in elevation and from 30 to 60 m (100-200 feet) above the adjacent plain. They consist of a belt of Pleistocene and Tertiary eolian deposits (Braun 1950) that are often deeply eroded and very steep, with fertile top soil and abundant moisture (Miller and Neiswender 1987). The vegetation is often richer than surrounding non-loessal areas, or those with only thin loess deposits. The forests found on these bluffs are intermediate in soil moisture for the region and may best be thought of as mesic. The vegetation may sometimes be referred to as western mesophytic forest and may share some superficial similarities with cove forests of the Interior Highlands. In many cases, these bluffs provide habitat for plant species that are rare or absent from other parts of the Coastal Plain. Braun (1950) noted that the composition of forest changes from north to south along the bluffs; more southerly examples are represented by the ~East Gulf Coastal Plain Southern Loess Bluff Forest (CES203.556)$$, and these would contain southern magnolia as an important component. As currently defined this system ranges northward from about 32 degrees N latitude (where the Big Black River cuts through the bluffs), and occurs only in the westernmost portions of the Upper East Gulf Coastal Plain, including northern and central Mississippi, western Tennessee, and western Kentucky, being restricted to the northern part of the Loess Bluff Hills (Ecoregion 74a of EPA (2004)).

Examples of this system occur on slopes and ravines between dry uplands and stream bottoms. Mesic forests of the loess bluffs are treated in separate ecological systems, being confined to that landform of steep bluffs and ravines on deep loess. The most characteristic feature of the vegetation in some examples may be American beech, but a variety of other hardwood species may also be found in the overstory, and American beech may not always be present. Some stands may be dominated by American beech and white oak, others by white oak or cherrybark oak with other mesic hardwoods. In addition, loblolly pine may be common in some examples in the southern portion of the range and, depending on previous disturbance and site conditions, may be locally dominant [see CEGL004763]. To the south this system is replaced by ~Southern Coastal Plain Mesic Slope Forest (CES203.476)$$, which is within the range of spruce pine and southern magnolia.

It is typically found on flat to rolling uplands with rich loam soils over glacial till.  This forest is characterized by a dense tree canopy that provides material for a thick layer of humus and leaf litter.  These provide nutrients for a dense and rich herbaceous layer. Sugar maple and beech comprise most of the canopy. Associates can include red oak, basswood, hornbeam, and hop-hornbeam. The herbaceous layer is very diverse and typically includes spring ephemerals - wildflowers that bloom in early spring before the trees have completed leaf-out.  Fire is very infrequent.  Beech-maple forests once covered large areas within their range but conversion to agriculture has significantly decreased the range of this forest, and very few large stands remain intact.

This forest system is distinguished by underlying moist soils and the predominance of hardwood species forming a moderately dense to dense canopy. Examples of this system occur on valley slopes and bottoms often with northern or eastern aspects. Soils are moderately well-drained, fertile, and medium to deep loams that have developed from glacial till or loess parent material. Sugar maple typifies this system, with American basswood and northern red oak also common. The dense canopy allows for a rich mixture of shrub and herbaceous species in the understory.

In the Ozarks, northern red oak increases in abundance compared to dry-mesic habitats, and sugar maple is sometimes a leading dominant. On more alkaline moist soils, chinquapin oak, American basswood, and eastern redbud may be common. In the Boston Mountains, mesic forests may also be common on protected slopes and terraces next to streams. Here, American beech may be the leading dominant, with codominants of sugar maple, sweetgum, American basswood, cucumber-tree, umbrella magnolia, and others. Similar habitats occur in the western Ouachita Mountains.

These high-diversity, predominately deciduous forests occur on deep and enriched soils, in non-montane settings and usually in somewhat protected landscape positions such as coves or lower slopes. Dominant species include sugar maple, beech, tuliptree, red oak, cucumber tree, and black walnut.  Hemlock may be a component of some stands. Trees may grow very large in undisturbed areas. The herb layer is very rich, often with abundant spring ephemerals. See also the Southern and Central Appalachian Cove Forest system, which is similar but occurs from the Allegheny Mountains eastward.
1	CONUS	127	127	01.C.2.D008M153E127	4401	Southern and Central Appalachian Cove Forest	"This system consists of mesophytic hardwood or hemlock-hardwood forests of sheltered topographic positions in the Blue Ridge and central Appalachian Mountains. Examples are generally found on concave slopes that promote moist conditions. The system includes a mosaic of acidic and ""rich"" coves, the latter with higher diversity and density in the herbaceous layer. Both acidic and rich coves may occur in the same site, with the acidic coves creeping out of the draw, up to at least midslope on well-protected north-facing slopes. Characteristic species in the canopy include yellow buckeye, sugar maple, white ash, basswood, tuliptree, mountain silverbell, beech, cucumber tree, mountain magnolia, and (mostly in acidic coves) hemlock. See also the South-Central Interior Mesophytic Forest system, which is similar to this but occurs west of the Allegheny Mountains."
1	CONUS	128	128	01.C.2.D008M153E128	4203	Southern Crowley's Ridge Mesic Loess Slope Forest	"This system of mesic upland forests is confined to Crowley's Ridge, along the western side of the lower Mississippi River. This vegetation and the ridge itself are very distinctive from that of the adjacent alluvial plain. The ridge is a remnant loess-capped feature rising from 30 m to over 60 m (100-200 feet) above the alluvial plain surface, to about 150 m (450 feet) above sea level. The base of the ridge is comprised of Tertiary substrates overlain by Quaternary alluvial deposits and capped with up to 15 m (50 feet) of Pleistocene loess. The system is generally comprised of mesic forests that occupy ravines between narrow, ""finger"" ridges and slopes in a highly dissected landscape. The sites tend to be more mesic than sites elsewhere in the southeastern United States. In many cases, these slopes and ravines provide habitat for plant species that are rare or absent from other parts of the alluvial plain (e.g., tuliptree, American basswood). Canopies are dominated by American beech, white oak, and tuliptree, with many associates."
1	CONUS	129	129	01.C.2.D008M153E129	4202	Southern Piedmont Mesic Forest	This system encompasses mixed deciduous hardwood (or occasionally hardwood-pine) forests of mesic sites in the Piedmont from Virginia southward. Most examples occur on lower or north-facing slopes where topography creates mesic moisture conditions. A mix of a small number of mesophytic trees is usually dominant, with beech most prominent. A few places support heath bluffs, where dense shrub layers of mesophytic heath shrubs occur beneath an open tree canopy. Fire is naturally infrequent in this system, due to the slopes and moist conditions. If fire does penetrate, it is likely to be low in intensity and may not have significant ecological effects.
1	CONUS	130	130	01.C.2.D008M159E130	4314	Appalachian Shale Barrens	The hot, dry, and rocky shale barrens are a distinctive system of the central Appalachians from West Virginia to Pennsylvania. Occurring at low to mid elevations, the substrate includes areas of solid rock as well as shale scree, usually steeply sloped. The exposure, steep slopes, unstable shale scree, and lack of soil create extreme conditions for plant growth. The barrens are usually a mosaic of woodlands and  large open areas of sparse vegetation. Dominant trees are primarily chestnut oak and Virginia pine, although on more alkaline substrates the common trees include red-cedar and white ash. Shale barren endemics-- plants specially adapted to be able to survive the harsh conditions--  are diagnostic in the herb layer, and these habitats support many rare species.
1	CONUS	131	131	01.C.2.D008M159E131	4211	Atlantic Coastal Plain Northern Maritime Forest	This system encompasses a range of woody vegetation present on barrier islands and near-coastal strands  from southeastern Virginia (Virginia Beach) northward along the  Atlantic Coastal Plain to Cape Cod. It includes forests and shrublands whose structure and composition are influenced by proximity to marine environments, including both upland and wetlands. Vegetation includes narrow bands of forests, often featuring stunted trees with contorted branches, and dense vine layers. Different trees may be present depending upon actual location and degree of protection from most extreme maritime influences; major species can include loblolly pine, pitch pine, black cherry, beech, post oak, and American holly.
1	CONUS	132	132	01.C.2.D008M159E132	5515	Laurentian Pine-Oak Barrens	Pine-oak barrens are found in pockets throughout the northern and western Great Lakes region.  They mainly occur on dry, sandy glacial outwash plains where wildfire could be quite frequent.  Jack pine, northern pin oak, and, to a lesser degree, red pine, eastern white pine, black oak, and white oak, are most common.  They tend to be surrounded by closed forests of jack pine and/or mixed oak and pine, where fires burn less frequently.  Some species known from tallgrass prairies may be common in oak-pine barrens, including little bluestem and big bluestem.  Other common species include Pennsylvania sedge, American hazelnut, and lowbush blueberry.  Oak 'grubs', or the shrubby forms of oak tree species, may be common in areas that burn frequently.  Intense wildfire in nearby forests may create large openings, impacting forest soils and converting them to 'bracken grasslands' that often appear similar to natural oak-pine barrens.
1	CONUS	133	133	01.C.2.D008M159E133	4539	Northeastern Interior Pine Barrens	Pitch pine barrens of inland regions of the northeastern U.S. occur on flat to rolling  glacial outwash plains, ancient sand dunes, and glacial till. The sandy soils are dry to very dry, acidic, and low in nutrients. Pitch pine is the usual dominant; open woodland is the typical cover.  Red oak, white pine, and gray birch are common associates. Thickets of scrub oak or dwarf chinkapin oak are common. A thick low-shrub layer is typical, with blueberry, huckleberry, and sweetfern characteristic. The barrens are often a patchwork of open pine woodlands, closed-canopy forest, scrub oak shrublands, and dwarf-shrub-herb frost pockets.  Small depressions can create pockets with saturated soil, dominated by shrubs such as hazelnut, buttonbush, highbush blueberry, and alder. Grassy areas dominated by little bluestem with native wild lupine, bushclover, and other forbs provide habitat for several rare invertebrates including the Karner blue butterfly.  Important vertebrate species include the hognose snake,  whippoorwill, nighthawk, and pine barrens treefrog. These barrens always have a history of recurrent fires, and fire is required to maintain them.
1	CONUS	134	134	01.C.2.D008M159E134	4540	Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain Pitch Pine Barrens	"This system is comprised of dry pitch pine woodlands of the coastal plain from Cape Cod south through Long Island and New Jersey, with occasional occurrences south to Maryland. The deep, sandy soils support various combinations of canopy of pitch pine or pine-oak, a tall-shrub layer dominated by shrubby oak species, and a low-shrub layer characterized by lowbush blueberry and other low shrubs. The composition and structure of this system are closely tied to fire frequency. In general, tree oaks are more prevalent in those stands with infrequent fire, while fires every 8-10 years foster the growth of ""pine plains,"" dwarf pine stands 1 meter in height. Dwarf-shrubs such as bearberry and golden-heather often form a ground layer in pine plains. Scrub oak stands may occur without pine cover, particularly in low-lying areas where cold-air drainage inhibits pine growth. Where the water table is close to the surface, pitch pine lowland (a separate system) occurs. These pine barrens are very similar in structure and composition to the Northeastern Interior Pine Barrens system but are characterized by additional species indicative of the coastal plain setting."
1	CONUS	135	135	01.C.2.D008M159E135	4537	Southern Appalachian Montane Pine Forest and Woodland	This system consists of predominantly evergreen woodlands occupying very exposed, convex, often rocky south- and west-facing slopes, ridge spurs, crests, and clifftops in the central Appalachians, Southern Ridge and Valley and Southern Blue Ridge. They occur at moderate to upper elevations (1500-4000 feet). The underlying rock is acidic and sedimentary or metasedimentary (e.g., quartzites, sandstones and shales). The soils are very infertile, shallow and droughty. A thick, poorly decomposed duff layer, along with dead wood and highly volatile heath shrubs, creates a strongly fire-prone habitat. Table Mountain pine is diagnostic and often dominant, occurring with pitch pine, Virginia pine, or Carolina hemlock.  The canopy is usually open, but areas of closed canopy may be present, especially where Carolina hemlock is prominent. In some areas pines may be able to maintain dominance due to edaphic conditions, such as very shallow soil or extreme exposure which can produce sustained drought conditions, but most sites appear eventually to succeed to oak in the absence of fire. Fire is also presumably a strong influence on vegetation structure, producing a more open woodland canopy structure and more herbaceous ground cover.
1	CONUS	136	136	01.C.2.D009M017E136	4602	East Cascades Mesic Montane Mixed-Conifer Forest and Woodland	"This ecological system is composed of variable montane coniferous forests typically below Pacific silver fir forests along the crest east of the Cascades. This system also includes montane forests along rivers and slopes, and in mesic ""coves"" which were historically protected from wildfires. Most occurrences of this system are dominated by a mix of Douglas-fir with grand fir and/or western hemlock. Several other conifers can dominate or codominate, including western red-cedar, lodgepole pine, western white pine, and western larch. Grand fir and other fire-sensitive, shade-tolerant species dominate forests on many sites once dominated by Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine, which were formerly maintained by wildfire. They are very productive forests in the eastern Cascades which have been priority stands for timber production."
1	CONUS	137	137	01.C.2.D009M017E137	4543	Middle Rocky Mountain Montane Douglas-fir Forest and Woodland	These dry, Douglas-fir forests and woodlands occur at middle to low elevations in mountains in the greater Yellowstone region and extend out in all directions within the Middle Rocky Mountains.  Limber pine or lodgepole pines may be present and form a mixed tree layer.  Common shrubs, such as mallow-leaf ninebark, common juniper, mountain snowberry, and creeping Oregon-grape often form a layer beneath the trees.  Grasses like pinegrass, Ross' sedge, and spike fescue are frequently present, but usually with low cover.
1	CONUS	138	138	01.C.2.D009M017E138	4524	Northern Rocky Mountain Dry-Mesic Montane Mixed Conifer Forest	These are variable mixed conifer forests, usually with Douglas fir present with some Ponderosa pine, often with some lodgepole pine, larch, or western white pine.  This system also includes the driest Douglas-fir - grand fir forests.  The understory of these forests are variable but often open, with grassses or deciduous shrubs.  Fire suppression is changing these forests, leading to greater dominance of grand fir, and reduced cover of Ponderosa pine.
1	CONUS	139	139	01.C.2.D009M017E139	5302	Northern Rocky Mountain Foothill Conifer Wooded Steppe	This system occurs at the broad transition between sagebrush and dry conifer forests.  It is comprised of Ponderosa pine or Douglas-fir savannas or open woodlands, with sagebrush and bitterbrush and bunchgrass understories.  They occur on dunes, rocky ridges, scablands, or broken rock where conditions prevent a typical forest or woodland from developing, but enough trees become established to form a savanna or open woodland.
1	CONUS	140	140	01.C.2.D009M017E140	4609	Northern Rocky Mountain Mesic Montane Mixed Conifer Forest	These are mid-elevation, moist to wet, mixed conifer forests found in the inland areas of the Pacific Northwest.  It occurs on valley bottoms, canyons and toesslopes where soil moisture is high, but sites are not flooded. Western hemlock and western red-cedar, with Douglas-fir are most common.  Moist grand fir forests are included.  Other trees such as  western white pine, lodgepole pine, Pacific yew, and western larch may be present. Ground cover is usually composed of moist forbs, ferns and/or deciduous shrubs like american twinflower, speckled alder, Rocky Mountain maple, spreading snowberry, and fool's-huckleberry. These forests are very productive and produce valuable timber.
1	CONUS	141	141	01.C.2.D009M017E141	4529	Northern Rocky Mountain Ponderosa Pine Woodland and Savanna	These ponderosa pine woodlands and savannas (grasslands with scattered trees) are found in the foothills in the northwestern US and western Canada.  Ponderosa pine is usually the only tree present, although occasionally Douglas-fir, limber pine, western larch or western juniper can be found.  It occurs on all slopes and aspects, and usually had a grass layer of pinegrass or Idaho fescue, historically characterized by widely spaced, very large pine trees.  Other common grasses include bluebunch wheatgrass, needlegrass, prairie fescue or dry sedges.  Shrubs such as antelope bitterbrush, basin big sagebrush, mountain snowberry and greenleaf manzanita are common, and increase with lack of fire. These woodlands and savannas were widespread in the interior northwest, although they are declining as the fires that maintained them are suppressed.
1	CONUS	142	142	01.C.2.D009M017E142	4510	Northern Rocky Mountain Western Larch Savanna	This ecological systemoccurs in  the interior montane zone of the Pacific Northwest in northern Idaho and adjacent Montana, Washington, Oregon, and in southeastern interior British Columbia. It also appears in the east Cascades of Washington.These are open woodlands and savannas dominated by western larch, historically maintained by fire.  Ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir can occur, but these are very open, with limitied tree cover.  Understory varies from grasses, low evergreen shrubs to deciduous shrubs, with the taller shrubs declining after fires.  These woodlands and savannas are disappearing as fires are suppressed, being invaded by grand fir, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce and hemlock.
1	CONUS	143	143	01.C.2.D009M017E143	4548	Northwestern Great Plains - Black Hills Ponderosa Pine Woodland and Savanna	These open pine woodlands and savannas are found in the northwestern Great Plains on gentle to steep slopes along escarpments, buttes, canyons, ridges, ravines and rocky areas.  Ponderosa pine in the most common tree and ranges from scatter large trees in a grassland (savanna) to dense trees on cooler north facing slopes, but is frequently an open woodland.  Junipers and some deciduous trees may be present. Prairie grasses are common (bluestem, grama, western wheatgrass, or junegrass) with occasional shrubs. The woodlands were often restricted to fire-protected rocky areas, but within the last century have expanded out into the prairie to become woodlands and forests because of successful fire prevention.  When fires do occur, they are often more severe now, killing the ponderosa pine trees.
1	CONUS	144	144	01.C.2.D009M017E144	4526	Rocky Mountain Foothill Limber Pine-Juniper Woodland	"These woodlands occur in the Rocky Mountain foothills from the northern Colorado Front Range to Montana extending east into the plains on rocky hills, especially on cooler north slopes. The trees are often patchy and it include tree ""savannas"" composed of either limber pine, Utah juniper, Rocky Mountain juniper, or a mix of these small trees. Sites are often rocky with few shrubs or grasses. However some sites may have more abundant shrub and grasses.  Sagebrush, mountain mahogany, antelope bitterbrush, and skunkbush are common shrubs and blue grama, needle-and-thread, prairie curly bluegrass, or bluebunch wheatgrass are common grasses. 
Burning is infrequent and spotty because generally rocky soils often lack continuous vegetation needed for fire to spread. Birds such as Clark's nutcracker will cache the large seeds from this pine and inadvertenly plant trees in new areas."
1	CONUS	145	145	01.C.2.D009M020E145	4324	Inter-Mountain Basins Aspen-Mixed Conifer Forest and Woodland	These are woodlands and forests found across the intermountain west, but especially in the mountains of the Colorado Plateua and Great Basin. They occur on moist soils on slopes in the mountains, but are also found on clay-rich soils in intermontane valleys. These forests are a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees, with quaking aspen always abundant, and one or more conifer species, especially ponderasa pine, Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, or lodgepole pine.  As the forest ages, quaking aspen slowly dies out until the conifer species become dominant.  Many different shrubs, grasses or herbs are found in these forests, which can be quite diverse in species. Many of these mixed forests are believed to have replaced pure aspen forests due to fire supression and heavy grazing.  Aspen is thin-barked and readily killed by fire, but it is adapted to fire by respouting from rootstock when the trees are killed.  Without fire, these mixed forests will slowly convert to a conifer-dominated forest.
1	CONUS	146	146	01.C.2.D009M020E146	4515	Inter-Mountain Basins Subalpine Limber-Bristlecone Pine Woodland	In the high mountains of the Great Basin and eastern California, limber pine and bristlecone pine woodlands are found on high-elevation ridges and rocky slopes above the subalpine forests. Site are harsh for woody plants, with drying winds, rocky soils and a short growing season.  These woodlands often are on southwestern-facing steep slopes, or on ridge tops.  The trees are widely-spaced, and gnarled when they are mature.  Intermountain bristlecone pines can reach ages well over 1500 years.  Shrubs, grasses and herbs are typically not abundant. Often the herbs are 'cushion plants', a group of plants with low, matted appearance which protects them from the dry, cold winds.  The seeds of limber pine are collected by Clark's nutcracker, and are cached by these birds for future food.  Sometimes the seed caches are not returned to by the nutcrackers, and clumbs of seeds will sprout, with many pine seedlings then growing all together.
1	CONUS	147	147	01.C.2.D009M020E147	4525	Northern Rocky Mountain Subalpine Woodland and Parkland	These are high-elevation stunted tree clumps, open woodlands, with herb- or dwarf-shrub-dominated openings, occurring above closed forest ecosystems and below alpine communities. The climate is typically very cold in winter and dry in summer. This system is found on ridgetops, mountain slopes, glacial trough walls and moraines, talus slopes, landslides and rockslides, and cirque headwalls and basins.  It includes open areas with clumps of whitebark pine, as well as woodlands dominated by whitebark pine or subalpine larch. In the Cascade Mountains and northeastern Olympic Mountains, the tree clump pattern is one manifestation, but these are also woodlands with an open canopy, without a tree clump/opening patchiness to them; in fact, that is quite common with whitebark pine.
1	CONUS	148	148	01.C.2.D009M020E148	4111	Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland	"Forests of quaking aspen are found all across the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin of the west. With their trembling green or gold leaves, and white bark, quaking aspen forests make for some of the most beautiful of western forests.  They occur across a wide range of elevations in the mountains, from about 1,525 to 3,050 meters, but require adequate rain or snow fall to maintain the soil moisture that deciduous trees need.  The shrubs, herbs and grasses found in aspen forests are very diverse.  Aspen is a ""clonal"" species, with groups of trees growing from the same roots spread through a large area.  After a fire (or other event such as avalanche, insect outbreak or clearcutting by man or beaver) kills a conifer or aspen forest, the aspen clones can rapidly resprout to become a new aspen forest. Some aspen clones are thought to be many centuries old, even though the trees themselves live about 150 years."
1	CONUS	149	149	01.C.2.D009M020E149	4527	Rocky Mountain Lodgepole Pine Forest	Lodgepole pine forests occur throughout the Rocky Mountains from Colorado north and west, from mid- to high-elevations (montane to subalpine).  They are usually open forests or dense woodlands dominated almost entirely by lodgepole pine, often 'even aged', meaning the trees all began growth at the same time, and are the same age.  In addition to lodgepole pine, other trees can occur, most commonly subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, quaking aspen, or douglas-fir.  Under the trees, there can be dense shrubs, or grassy swards, or even mostly barren ground.  Lodgepole forests usually establish following a fire, because this species can rapidly begin seedling growth in areas where other trees have been killed by fires.  This is because the cones are tightly sealed by sap, releasing the seeds only when they are burned.  The seeds then germinate on bare ground where fire has removed the duff layer of old needles.  Lodgepole forests in central Colorado are currently suffering high death rates of mature trees due to an epidemic of pine bark beetles.
1	CONUS	150	150	01.C.2.D009M020E150	4544	Rocky Mountain Poor-Site Lodgepole Pine Forest	These are subalpine forests, occasionally found at lower elevations, where lodgepole pine is the most common tree due to rocky and nutrient-poor soils. Places include well-drained pumice deposits, glacial till and alluvium on valley floors where cold-air pools in the evenings, on warm, dry shallow soils over fractured quartzite bedrock, or on shallow dry soils of volcanic ash.  Following a fire that kills all the trees previously growing on a site, lodgepole pine will rapidly sprout from seed, and grow into dense, even-aged (trees of the same age) forests.  Other conifers cannot grow on these extreme sites. These forests are dominated by lodgepole pine with shrubs and grasses, or be barren of growth under the trees. Sometimes there are intermingled mixed conifer/quaking aspen stands that occur on pockets of deep finer-textured soils. In central Oregon, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and white fir may be present as well.  Shrubs may be dense or not  present at all.
1	CONUS	151	151	01.C.2.D009M020E151	4531	Rocky Mountain Subalpine Dry-Mesic Spruce-Fir Forest and Woodland	"These are the most abundant high elevation conifer forests and woodlands found in mountains of the western US, occurring on cold, higher elevation, dry to moist sites.  They are not found on wetter upland sites, such as north-facing toeslopes and moist valley bottoms. In addition to Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir, Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine trees may be common. Quaking aspen may be present in some stands.  Near upper treeline, because of wind and snow deposition, these woodlands may form patchy ""islands"" or ribbons of trees, sometimes with a shrubby (krummholz) growth form.  Common shrubs and dwarf-shrubs are creeping Oregon-grape, common juniper, or grouseberry, while black crowberry, Cascade azalea, and square-twig blueberry shrubs are common in the northern Rockies. Natural disturbances are occasional blowdown, insect outbreaks and severe fire (200-350 years).  Disturbance from logging is common where more accessible."

These are the major subalpine forests of the northern Rockies, found on gentle to very steep mountain slopes, high-elevation ridgetops and upper slopes, plateau-like surfaces, basins, alluvial terraces, well-drained benches, and inactive stream terraces.  In drier and warmer regions, such as Colorado and New Mexico, they occur in cooler and moister landscape settings, such as north-facing slopes, areas with late-lying snow, or toeslopes.  They are dominated by Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir, and the shrubs, grasses and wildflowers found with them are highly diverse.  These forests burn very infrequently.
1	CONUS	153	153	01.C.2.D009M020E153	4532	Rocky Mountain Subalpine-Montane Limber-Bristlecone Pine Woodland	These woodlands occur throughout the southern and central Rocky Mountains and extend west into the Colorado Plateau region.  They thrive in adverse environments that are dry, rocky and windy, often on exposed ridges and warmer south or west facing slopes at montane to upper treeline.  These woodlands are composed of limber pine or bristlecone pine trees with Rocky Mountain juniper, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce or Douglas-fir trees less common in the tree canopy. These pines are long-lived with some individuals living over 2000 years and have wind-sculped branches that are knarled and twisted.  Birds such as Clark's nutcracker will cache the large seeds from these pines and inadvertenly plant trees in new areas.

They are usually found on rocky soils with some moisture held by the soils. These woodlands are dominated by bigtooth maple but may include mixed stands codominated by Gambel oak, scattered conifers, box-elder or quaking aspen. It also occurs on steeper, north-facing slopes at higher elevations, often adjacent to Rocky Mountain Gambel Oak-Mixed Montane Shrubland or Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland.
1	CONUS	155	155	01.C.2.D009M022E155	4528	Southern Rocky Mountain Dry-Mesic Montane Mixed Conifer Forest and Woodland	Dry forests and woodlands with a mix of conifer trees that occur throughout the southern Rocky Mountains.  In this region of relatively dry climate, they are found on all aspects on mountain slopes, ridges and ridge tops, canyon side slopes, and plateaus.  The mix of trees is variable, depending on elevation and moisture conditions, as well as how long since the last fire. Douglas-fir forests occupy drier sites, often with ponderosa pine.  At higher, cooler elevations white fir is commonly found, along with blue spruce, quaking aspen, and limber pine.  As many as seven conifer tree species can be found growing together. The shrubs and grasses are adapted to drier conditions. In the past, fires were variable in how often and how severe they were.  Now, fires have been prevented and many of these forests don't burn very often.  However, when they do burn the fires are severe, and kill most of the trees.
1	CONUS	156	156	01.C.2.D009M022E156	4610	Southern Rocky Mountain Mesic Montane Mixed Conifer Forest and Woodland	Mesic mixed conifer forests are found in cool, moist locations of the southern Rocky Mountains.  They grow on lower and middle slopes of ravines, on stream terraces, on north- or east-facing slopes, and other places where soils are moist.  Douglas-fir, blue spruce, and  white fir are the most common trees, but Engelmann spruce or ponderosa pine may be present.  Quaking aspen is also sometimes found.  Many different deciduous shrubs often form a dense layer under the trees, such as Rocky Mountain maple, bigtooth maple, speckled alder, red-osier dogwood, five-petal cliffbush, mallow-leaf ninebark, New Mexico locust, square-twig blueberry, and whortleberry. Many herbs and grass-like plants can be found, including fringed brome, Geyer's sedge, Ross' sedge, dry-spike sedge, screwleaf muhly, fleabane, Virginia strawberry, small-flower woodrush, mountain sweet-cicely, bittercress ragwort, and meadowrue. Fires do not happen often due to the moist, cool conditions.
1	CONUS	157	157	01.C.2.D009M022E157	5605	Southern Rocky Mountain Ponderosa Pine Savanna	This system is best described as a savanna that has widely spaced ponderosa pine trees. They occur at the lower treeline, where montane forests give way to valley grasslands. Elevations range from less than 1900 m northern Wyoming to 2700 m on the higher plateaus of the interior southwest. This system is found on rolling plains, plateaus, or dry slopes usually on more southerly aspects. Savannas are  maintained by a fire pattern of frequent, low-intensity surface (burning in the grass and needle litter) fires. A healthy example often consists of open and park-like stands dominated by ponderosa pine. Grasses and herbs grow under the trees, and usually are species that resprout following surface fires.  Shrubs and downed logs are uncommon. A century of human disturbance and fire suppression has resulted in a higher density of ponderosa pine trees, altering the fire patterns and species composition. Presently, many ponderosa pine savannas have lots of younger trees of Douglas-fir or fir, as well as younger ponderosa pine.

These woodlands are found on all slopes and aspects but can be common on steep slopes or ridgetops. Ponderosa pine is the common tree; Douglas-fir, two-needle pinyon, lodgepole pine, quaking aspen, and juniper  may be present. Under the trees is usually shrubby, with  sagebrush, manzanita, bearberry, mountain-mahogany, cliffrose, bitterbrush, Gambel oak, snowberry, choke cherry, Saskatoon serviceberry (less so in Montana), and wild rose. Diverse mixes of grasses and herbs are also ofund.  The patterns of fire are variable, with sometimes high-intensity, infreqent fires, or in some cases more freqeunt, low intensity fires.

They include Ponderosa pine woodlands, Jeffrey pine woodlands, or occasionally mixes of the two.  Rarely in the northern Modoc, Washoe pine replaces Jeffrey pine.  At the drier edges, western Juniper occurs.  Historically these were open with grassy understories, but most stands now have shrubby understories dominated by snowberry, bitterbrush, sagebrush, evergreen, and ceanothus. due to fire suppression.

In the transverse ranges of southern California, incense cedar can be codominant with white fir in this sytem, but further north white fir is an indicator of the moist-mesic mixed conifer system. These forests and woodlands were fire maintained ecosystems, mostly now found on ridgetops, south and west-facing slopes, Evergreen and deciduous hardwoods can occur in the understory, but if these make up even 20% of the canopy they are classified as a different system.  The understory is variable, usually with deciduous shrubs, evergreen shrubs and wildflower present.

In limited locations in the central Sierra Nevada, giant sequoia dominates, usually with white fir, and at the highest elevations also with California red fir. These forests are variable, with diverse understories containing evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs and forbs.  These forests have expanded in lower areas of the mountains with fire suppression.
1	CONUS	164	164	01.C.2.D009M023E164	4546	Sierran-Intermontane Desert Western White Pine-White Fir Woodland	This system represents mid to high elevation, open woodlands dominated by western white pine, occasionally with white fir, occuring in the desert mountains of Nevada, south-central Oregon and eastern California.   They occur on all slopes and aspects, but most frequently are found on drier areas, including southeast and northwest slopes and ridges.  They are comprised of large, widely spaced white pine trees with a grass, or mixed grass - forb and shrub understory.  At the lower edges of stands, or on north slopes or moist sites, white fir can be an important component of these stands, along with Ponderosa pine at the lower elevations, or occasionally lodgepole pine.  Douglas fir, incense cedar and sugar pine are not present in this system.
1	CONUS	165	165	01.C.2.D009M024E165	4601	California Coastal Redwood Forest	These are giant conifers forests, found in the coastal fog belt.  Among the tallest forests in the world, coast redwood, Port Orford cedar, Douglas fir and western hemlock trees grow over 300 feet tall, sometimes with tanoak and laurel subcanopies over 100 feet tall.  They occur on river terraces and coastal slopes.  Understory plants are diverse and typical of coastal conifer forests, although usually are composed of evergreen shrubs or perennial wildflowers. These beautiful tall trees are not to be confused with their Sierran foothill cousins, the Sequoia Redwood, which tend to be larger in girth.
1	CONUS	166	166	01.C.2.D009M024E166	4148	North Pacific Broadleaf Landslide Forest and Shrubland	These are forests or shrublands, usually found on recent or unstabilized landslides, most commonly on toeslopes above rivers, or immediately along the coast or anywhere else landslides are common.  Throughout most of the region, they are dominated by red alder, although other deciduous species salmonberry, thimbleberry, currents, devil's club and sometimes bigleaf maple can also be codominant.  Similar looking habitats are created following logging of unstable slopes. Compare this with the North Pacific Avalanche Chute Shrubland, which occurs at higher elevations, and rather than landslides, is created by avalanches.

These are giant conifer forests, with trees often over 250 feet tall if undisturbed.  The understory is variable, including shrubs, forbs, or ferns, and extensive down logs and snags.
1	CONUS	168	168	01.C.2.D009M024E168	4604	North Pacific Hypermaritime Sitka Spruce Forest	These are coastal forests dominated by Sitka spruce, and often have a mixture of other conifers present, such as western hemlock, western red-cedar, or Alaska yellow-cedar.  Western hemlock is very often codominant.  These forests are restricted to areas within 25 km of saltwater and are most abundant along the coast of Vancouver Island, southern and northern portions of coastal British Columbia, the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, and the islands of southeastern Alaska.  They live on the outermost coastal fringe where salt spray is prominent, stream side terraces and valley bottoms near the coast where there is major fog accumulation. Along coastal bluffs, these are open forests with dense evergreen shrub understories, but a little further inland they are more typical, coastal tall conifer rain-forests, with towering trees and prolific ferns.
1	CONUS	169	169	01.C.2.D009M024E169	4613	North Pacific Hypermaritime Western Red-cedar-Western Hemlock Forest	These are tall coastal conifer forests dominated by western hemlock and western red cedar.  They are found at low elevations, and usually within 15 miles of the ocean, with cool summers, abundant fog, very wet winters without a major snowpack.  Most remnants are old-growth forests with dense understories of evergreen shrubs such as salal and evergreen huckleberry, deciduous shrubs (fools and red huckleberry), and ferns (swordfern and deer fern).  The abundance of western red-cedar in relation to other conifers is one of the diagnostic characters of these forests; the other is the low abundance of Douglas-fir and Sitka spruce.  Where these forests are best developed they occur in a mosaic with forested wetlands, bogs, and Sitka spruce forests, which are often found on stream banks and on steep, nutrient rich soils.

They occur in a matrix with the moist-site Douglas-fir western hemlock forest system.  Historically they were characterized bytall Douglas fir forests, with western hemlock co-dominant or occasional in the understory, sometimes along with grand fir or western red cedar, although many have become conifer plantations.  These dry-site stands have understory species such as salal, Oregon grape, rhododendron, and twinflower with the ubiquitous swordfern.

They occur in a matrix with the dry-site Douglas-fir western hemlock forest system.  Historically they were characterized by a mixed of tall western hemlock, western red cedar and Douglas fir forests, although many have become conifer plantations. These moist-site giant conifer forests have understory species such as swordfern, Oregon oxalis, salmonberry, devil's club, vanilla-leaf, and huckleberry.

Pacific silver fir, western hemlock and western red cedar are the dominant trees of these forests, which rarely support Douglas-fir.  The forests are varied, although most of these have some shrubs in the understory, and many are dominated by huckleberry evergreen, Alaska, or red.
1	CONUS	174	174	01.C.2.D009M024E174	4552	North Pacific Wooded Volcanic Flowage	This system represents the woodlands, savannas and open forests that occur on the recent lava flows found throught the Cascades of the Pacific Northwest.  The system includes lava flows from 2000 to 8200 years old, as well as other volcanic events in these northwest systems pyroclastic flows, mudflows, lahars, and debris avalanches create openings in the northwest conifer forests, which are slowly repopulated by plant life.  Depending on the age and elevation, they can be dominated by a combination of Douglas-fir, vine maple, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, or western white pine, along with the native shrubs and forbs from the area.  However, barren lava, pumice or volcanic boulders comprise most of the cover in these areas.
1	CONUS	175	175	01.C.2.D009M025E175	4318	Mediterranean California Red Fir Forest	These are high mountain forests and woodlands dominated by red fir, either California red fir, Shasta red fir or noble fir.  They are found usually on deep, well drained soils, often on ridges, moutain terraces or slopes, usually in areas with heavy snowpack.  Other conifers can often be found, but are not usually important.  The understory is variable, often composed of evergreen shrubs; sometimes deciduous shrubs and forbs are more important.  The system occurs  just higher in the mountains from mixed conifer forests dominated by white fir, and is replaced by Mountain hemlock forests and woodlands to the north.

1	CONUS	178	178	01.C.2.D009M025E178	4523	North Pacific Mountain Hemlock Forest	Forests and woodlands found in the mountains of the northwest.  These forests are always dominated by mountain hemlock, and occur just below the subalpine zone, with heavy snowpacks in the winter and short, cool summers.  The trees get quite large for montane forests, often having an open understory of grasslike plants, such as woodrush, reedgrass, and fescue, deciduous shrubs such as thin-leaved blueberry, Cascades azalea, grouseberry or evergreen shrubs, including rhododendron, prince's pine, and mountain juniper.  Other conifers (subalpine, silver or red fir, Engelmann spruce, Alaska yellow cedar, and Douglas-fir) often are found in these forests with mountain hemlock.

Woodlands are found on concave or mesic slopes in areas with long-lasting snowpack and better soil development than other drier and more exposed subalpine woodlands. The tree canopy is characterized by mountain hemlock and may include California red fir, noble fir, whitebark pine, and western white pine. Mesic-site shrubs will include western moss heather, red mountain-heath, pink mountain-heath, square-twig blueberry, and others. Common juniper is found in most stands of the northern Sierra Nevada. Timberline beardtongue, as well as patches of grasses, sedges, and forbs grade into adjacent meadows.

They have open understory, often barren with grasses and dry sedges dominant, with patches of evergreen shrubs such as ceanothus and manzanita.  These are usually cold and dry forests, sometimes occurring near more characteristic subalpine pine woodlands.
1	CONUS	182	182	01.C.2.D010M026E182	4513	Columbia Plateau Western Juniper Woodland and Savanna	These open western juniper woodlands and savannas (grasslands with scattered trees) are found on low hills and foothills in the northwestern US.  Occasional ponderosa or Jeffery pines may be present, but single-leaf pinyon is absent. Curl-leaf mountain-mahogany may be common in some areas.  Basin big sagebrush is the most common shrub, although antelope bitterbrush, rubber rabbitbrush, green rabbitbrush, and horsebrush are often present.  Idaho fescue, curly bluegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass and threadleaf sedge are common in the grass layer.  These woodlands were generally limited to rocky areas where fires are few.  Recently, however their range has greatly expanded into sagebrush steppe and bunchgrass-dominated grasslands because of reduced fire frequency caused by removal of fine fuels by grazing livestock and fire suppression.
1	CONUS	183	183	01.C.2.D010M026E183	4514	Great Basin Pinyon-Juniper Woodland	These woodlands occur on dry mountain ranges of the Great Basin region and eastern foothills of the Sierra Nevada.  They are found on warm, dry sites on mountain slopes, mesas, plateaus and ridges, above the valleys where sagebrush is dominant.  Severe weather events occurring during the growing season, such as frosts and drought, are thought to limit the distribution of pinyon-juniper woodlands to a relatively narrow altitudinal zones. Singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper, alone or mixed together, are the main trees.  Curl-leaf mountain-mahogany is also common with the pinyon-juniper.  Shrubs and grasses may be abundant to absent all together. Typical species include manzanita, sagebrush, blackbrush, turbinella live oak, needle-and-thread grass, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, great basin lyme grass, and muttongrass.

These extensive woodlands and shrublands are common across the Great Basin from the Sierra Nevada and extend east into south-central Montana and western Colorado.  Most areas have exposed rock and bunchgrasses sometimes with scattered mountain sagebrush, bitterbrush, snowberry shrubs or  juniper and pinyon trees. Curl-leaf mountain-mahogany is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant shrub that generally does not resprout after burning and needs the protection from fire that rocky sites provide.  It will recolonized a burned area if a seed source is available.  Mountain-mahogany is important food for deer and elk.

A savanna is a very open woodland  that usually is accompanied by abundant perennial bunchgrasses (growing in clumps) and wildflowers.  These very open woodlands grade into true pinyon - juniper forests and woodlands, and to the south Utah juniper can be replaced by desert or one-seeded juniper, or hybrids with Utah juniper.

Pinyon-juniper woodlands are the predominant low elevation woodlands of this region, on warm, dry sites on mountain slopes, mesas, plateaus, and ridges. Severe weather events occurring during the growing season, such as frosts and drought, are thought to limit the distribution of pinyon-juniper woodlands to relatively narrow altitudinal zones. Two-needle pinyon and Utah juniper are the most common trees. Shrubs and grasses may be scattered or absent, some of the most common include manzanita, sagebrush, mountain-mahogany, blackbrush, cliffrose, bitterbrush, Gambel oak, blue grama, James' galleta, bluebunch wheatgrass, curly bluegrass, or muttongrass.
1	CONUS	188	188	01.C.2.D010M027E188	5606	Southern Rocky Mountain Juniper Woodland and Savanna	This juniper savanna is grassland with scattered mature juniper trees (>150 years old).  It includes local areas of more dense juniper trees that form woodland patches. Elevationally it occurs below the ponderosa pine zone in the transition between foothillls and plains in the southern Rocky Mountains in northern New Mexico and southerneastern Colorado  extending out into the valleys and plains. One-seed juniper is the most common tree. Sites are generally too warm and dry for pinyon trees, however an occasional pinyon tree may be present. Common grasses are similar to those in the shortgrass steppe such as with blue grama and James' galleta. Succulents such as species of yucca and pricklypear and dwarf-shrubs like snakeweed are often present. These savannas have greatly expanded into adjacent grasslands during the last century because of fewer prairie fires.  Invasive savannas can be identified by having mostly young juniper trees.

This system occurs in the upper Missouri River Basin and includes parts of the Niobrara, White, Cheyenne, Little Missouri, Yellowstone, Powder, Bighorn, Milk, and Musselshell rivers. Alluvial soils and periodic, intermediate flooding (every 5-25 years) typify this system. These are the perennial big rivers of the region with hydrologic dynamics largely driven by snowmelt in the mountains. Communities within this system range from floodplain forests to wet meadows to gravel/sand flats, however, they are linked by underlying soils and flooding regime. Grass cover underneath the trees is an important part of this system.  This system is often subjected to heavy grazing and/or agriculture and can be heavily degraded.  Groundwater depletion and lack of fire have created additional species changes. In most cases, the majority of the wet meadow and prairie communities may be extremely degraded or lost from the system.

It occurs on the lower reaches of the North and South Platte, Platte, Arkansas, and Canadian rivers. Alluvial soils and periodic, intermediate flooding (every 5-25 years) typify this system. These are the perennial big rivers of the region with hydrologic dynamics largely driven by snowmelt in the mountains. Common communities within this system range from floodplain forests to wet meadows to gravel/sand flats, however, they are linked by underlying soils and the flooding regime. Grass cover underneath the trees is an important part of this system. Tamarix and less desirable grasses and forbs can invade degraded areas within the floodplains. These areas are often subjected to heavy grazing and/or agriculture and can be heavily degraded. Another factor is that groundwater depletion and lack of fire have created additional species changes. In most cases, the majority of the wet meadow and prairie communities may be extremely degraded or gone from the system.

They usually occur within shortgrass prairie or other types of grasslands.   They occur in draws and along small rivers in deep cut ravines to wider meandering streambeds. Flows in these streams can be flashy, and may dry down completely for some portion of the year.  Dominant species vary with the size of the stream and valley type.  Plains cottonwood, willows and silver sagebrush are the most common with an herbaceous understory composed of grasses including little bluestem, western wheatgrass, and sand dropseed.  When heavily use, such as too frequent livestock grazing, or heavy agricultural runoff, increasing streams salinity, non-native trees such as tamarisk and russion olive can replace the native species.

1	CONUS	197	197	01.C.3.D011M029E197	9818	Central Interior and Appalachian Floodplain Systems	This systems group encompasses large-river floodplains over much of the eastern United States. Mostly forested, these systems occur on floodplains of medium to large rivers where topography and process have resulted in the development of a relatively flat, well-developed floodplain with a complex of upland and wetland temperate alluvial vegetation. Many examples of these systems will contain well-drained levees, terraces and stabilized bars, and some will include herbaceous sloughs and shrub wetlands, particularly in abandoned channels. The substrate is primarily alluvium. The generally fertile soils are usually sandy to loamy but include local clayey and gravelly areas. This complex includes floodplain forests as well as herbaceous sloughs and shrub wetlands. Emergent and vegetated bars of gravel to cobble are included here as well, as are scoured bedrock areas. The dominant structure is forest, where characteristic trees include Acer saccharinum, Populus deltoides, Betula nigra, Celtis laevigata, Liquidambar styraciflua (in the southern half of this group's range), willows, especially Salix nigra in the wettest areas, and Platanus occidentalis, with Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Ulmus americana, Liriodendron tulipifera, Quercus michauxii, Quercus pagoda, and (at least in the Midwest) Quercus macrocarpa in more well-drained areas. The particular mix of tree species will vary across the geographic range of this systems group, with some trees absent over parts of the range; for example, Celtis, Liquidambar, and Quercus macrocarpa are absent from the Susquehanna drainage in Pennsylvania. Understory species are mixed but include shrubs, such as Cephalanthus occidentalis, Cornus drummondii, and Asimina triloba, sedges (Carex spp.) and grasses (such as Elymus hystrix, Elymus canadensis, Chasmanthium latifolium, and others) which sometimes form savanna-like vegetation. Oxbows may support herbaceous vegetation dominated by species including Nelumbo lutea and Typha latifolia. Canebrakes dominated by Arundinaria gigantea ssp. gigantea are present in some areas. Frequently reworked gravelbars may be dominated by young Salix nigra, Platanus occidentalis, or Betula nigra, or they may have sparse vegetation of a wide variety of annual and perennial herbs of weedy habits. Occasional bedrock-scour areas in gorges have distinctive vegetation dominated by perennial herbs rooted in pockets and crevices. Most floodplains are underwater each spring, and some areas may be submerged by high-water events during the growing season. Microtopography determines how long the various habitats are inundated. Floodplain morphology can be altered by occasional severe floods. Depositional and erosional features may both be present depending on the particular floodplain, although there is a history of deposition in the floodplain formation.
1	CONUS	198	198	01.C.3.D011M029E198	9819	Central Interior and Appalachian Riparian Systems	"This riverscour-influenced systems group occurs on moderately to very high-gradient streams over a wide range of elevations. It develops on small floodplains and shores along river channels that lack a broad, flat floodplain due to steeper sideslopes, higher gradient, or both. Flooding is the major process affecting the vegetation, with the substrate more rapidly drained than in flat floodplain areas. These systems are affected by flood-scouring in some areas and deposition in others. The vegetation is often a mosaic including various combinations of forest, woodland, shrubland, and herbaceous communities. The non-forested components are particularly distinctive. The succession of woody plants (particularly trees) is retarded by the force of ""flashy,"" high-velocity water traveling down the stream channels. Common trees include Betula nigra, Platanus occidentalis, and Acer negundo. Where somewhat more stable, linear forests develop; typical trees include Liriodendron tulipifera, Liquidambar styraciflua, Acer rubrum, Celtis laevigata, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Quercus michauxii, and Quercus pagoda. Some common shrubs, occurring as forest/woodland understory or as non-forested shrublands, include Alnus serrulata, Cephalanthus occidentalis, Cornus amomum, Lindera benzoin, Salix caroliniana and other Salix spp., Toxicodendron radicans, and, over parts of the range, Fothergilla major, Hypericum densiflorum, Itea virginica, and Rhododendron arborescens. More southern examples may contain Hydrangea quercifolia, Hypericum densiflorum, and Morella cerifera (= Myrica cerifera var. cerifera); Hamamelis vernalis is characteristic in the Ozark/Ouachita region. Open, flood-scoured rivershore prairies feature Andropogon gerardii, Sorghastrum nutans, Schizachyrium scoparium, Chasmanthium latifolium, Tripsacum dactyloides, and/or Panicum virgatum. Carex torta is typical of wetter areas near the channel. Forbs are diverse and variable from occurrence to occurrence. Some characteristic forbs are Baptisia australis, Conoclinium coelestinum (= Eupatorium coelestinum), Coreopsis pubescens, Coreopsis tripteris, Elephantopus carolinianus, Helenium autumnale, Hydrocotyle sp., Ludwigia leptocarpa, Lycopus spp., Orontium aquaticum, Osmunda regalis var. spectabilis, Oxypolis rigidior, Phlox carolina, Pityopsis graminifolia var. latifolia, Rudbeckia laciniata, and Vernonia gigantea. Distinctive shoals with Hymenocallis coronaria and/or Justicia americana may be present as well. Small seeps and fens can often be found within these habitats, especially at the headwaters and terraces of streams. These areas are typically dominated by primarily wetland obligate species of sedges (Carex spp.), ferns (Osmunda spp.), and other herbaceous species such as Impatiens capensis. Flood-scouring is a powerful and ecologically important abrasive force along these riparian habitats. However, in contrast to larger floodplain systems, these systems have little to no floodplain development (i.e., floodplains, if present, are not differentiated into levees, sloughs, ridges, terraces, and abandoned channel segments) and often contain cobblebars and steep banks. They are typically higher gradient than larger floodplains and experience periodic, strong flooding of short duration."
1	CONUS	199	199	01.C.3.D011M029E199	9820	Laurentian-Acadian Floodplain Systems	This systems group encompasses north-temperate and sub-boreal floodplains in the northeastern and north-central U.S. and adjacent Canada north of the range of Platanus occidentalis. Most occur along medium to large rivers where topography and process have resulted in the development of a complex of upland and wetland, temperate, alluvial vegetation on generally flat topography. This complex includes floodplain forests, with Acer saccharinum characteristic, as well as herbaceous sloughs and shrub wetlands. Most areas are underwater each spring; microtopography determines how long the various habitats are inundated. Associated trees include Acer rubrum and Carpinus caroliniana, the latter frequent but never abundant. On terraces or in more calcareous areas, Acer saccharum or Quercus rubra may be locally prominent, with Betula alleghaniensis and Fraxinus spp. Salix nigra is characteristic of the levees adjacent to the channel. Common shrubs include Cornus amomum and Viburnum spp. The herb layer in the forested portions often features abundant spring ephemerals, giving way to a fern-dominated understory in many areas by mid-summer. Non-forested wetlands associated with these systems include shrub-dominated and graminoid-herbaceous vegetation.  Two uncommon expressions occur along sub-boreal rivers in northernmost New England and adjacent Canada: ice-scour rivershores and boreal floodplain forests. The ice-scour rivershores lack extensive forests because spring iceflows prevent floodplain forests from developing, except in small and widely scattered pockets; the vegetation consists of shrublands, tall grasslands, graminoid-forb-dwarf-shrub shoreline seeps, and rivershore outcrops. Characteristic shrubs include Alnus incana and Alnus viridis ssp. crispa (= Alnus crispa), Myrica gale, Cornus sericea, Salix eriocephala and many other Salix spp., and Dasiphora fruticosa ssp. floribunda. Characteristic herbaceous species vary with the setting, although Calamagrostis canadensis is ubiquitous. Soils in some areas remain saturated by seepage waters; other patches are well-drained for most of the growing season. These rivershores are flooded every spring, with summer floods in occasional years. The extent of ice-scour varies from year to year according to the snowpack and conditions during ice-out. The location and extent of shrub versus herb cover will vary in time and space according to how recent and severe the scour events have been. Boreal floodplain forests, north of the range of Acer saccharinum, develop in areas not strongly influenced by ice-scour (i.e., depositional), where topography and process have resulted in a complex of upland and wetland alluvial vegetation. This complex includes floodplain forests dominated by northern trees such as Populus balsamifera and Fraxinus nigra, as well as herbaceous sloughs and shrub wetlands. Most are underwater each spring; microtopography determines how long the various habitats are inundated.

In contrast to larger floodplain systems, this system has little to no floodplain development and often contains cobble bars and steep banks. It is traditionally experiences periodic, strong flooding. It is often characterized by a cobble bar with forest immediately adjacent with little to no marsh development. Canopy cover can vary within examples of this system, but typical tree species include sweetgum, sycamore, river birch, maples, and oaks. The richness of the herbaceous and shrub layers can vary significantly, ranging from species-rich to species-poor. Small seeps and fens can often be found within this system, especially at the headwaters and terraces of streams. Flooding and scouring strongly influence this system and prevent the floodplain development found on larger rivers.

It occurs along large rivers or streams where topography and alluvial processes have resulted in a well-developed floodplain. A single occurrence may extend from river's edge across the outermost extent of the floodplain or to where it meets a wet meadow or upland system. Many will contain well-drained levees, terraces and stabilized bars, and some will include herbaceous sloughs and shrub wetlands resulting, in part, from beaver activity. Although vegetation is quite variable in this broadly defined system. Understory species are mixed, but include shrubs, such as buttonbush and sedges. This system usually floods at least once annually and can be altered by occasional severe floods. Impoundments and conversion to agriculture have also impacted this system.

Many examples of this system will contain well-drained levees, terraces and stabilized bars, and some will include herbaceous sloughs and shrub wetlands resulting, in part, from beaver activity.  A variety of soil types may be found within the floodplain from very well-drained sandy substrates to very dense clays.  It is this variety of substrates in combination with different flooding regimes that creates the mix of vegetation.  Most areas, except for the montane alluvial forests, are inundated at some point each spring; microtopography determines how long the various habitats are inundated.

Examples occur along small streams and floodplains with low to moderately high gradients. There is be little to moderate floodplain development. Flooding and scouring both influence this system, and the nature of the landscape prevents the kind of floodplain development found on larger rivers. This system may contain cobble bars with adjacent wooded vegetation and rarely have any marsh development, except through occasional beaver impoundments. The vegetation is a mosaic of forests, woodlands, shrublands, and herbaceous communities. Typical tree species include sycamore, river birch, Carolina red maple, sweet gum, and oak. Shrubs and herbaceous layers vary in richness and cover. Small seeps dominated by sedges, ferns, and other herbaceous species can often be found within this system, especially at the headwaters and terraces of streams.
1	CONUS	204	204	01.C.3.D011M030E204	9212	Central Interior and Appalachian Swamp Systems	"This systems group includes swamps that occur primarily in the glaciated landscape of the eastern United States, with outliers found to the south of the periglacial landscape. Most are small-patch features, but some may be more extensive in larger basins or wet flats; in either case, they are usually discrete elements of the landscape. The acidic substrate is typically mineral soil with a component of organic muck; there may be a peaty epipedon. In some cases, such as kettleholes, a true peat substrate develops. Vegetation physiognomy ranges from forested swamps to semi-open fens. Forested swamps may be dominated by Tsuga canadensis mixed with deciduous wetland trees such as Acer rubrum or Nyssa sylvatica; or in areas with higher pH and/or nutrient levels, by Acer rubrum and Fraxinus nigra, with calciphilic herbs and sometimes with Larix laricina. High-elevation wetlands in the Allegheny Mountains are characterized by additional northern elements such as Abies balsamea and Picea rubens, with open shrub- and graminoid-dominated fens and occasional bogs. Common species in the understory layers of these wetlands include Carex spp., Osmunda cinnamomea, Cephalanthus occidentalis, Alnus spp., Rhododendron maximum, Hypericum densiflorum, and Ilex spp. The hemlock-dominated swamps generally develop in larger lowland basins. In kettleholes or other deep glacial depressions, semi-open fens develop (colloquially called kettlehole ""bogs""), where the nutrient-poor substrate and the reduced throughflow of water create oligotrophic conditions fostering the development of Sphagnum peat and the growth of peatland vegetation. Ericaceous shrubs and dwarf-shrubs (e.g., Chamaedaphne calyculata) dominate, with patches of graminoid dominance. Some may have a sparse tree layer, with Acer rubrum and/or Nyssa sylvatica characteristic. Many, though not all, of these swamps have a bryoid layer featuring Sphagnum."
1	CONUS	206	206	01.C.3.D011M030E206	9308	Laurentian-Acadian Alkaline Conifer-Hardwood Swamp	These forested wetlands are uncommon in the glaciated northeast except in areas with extensive limestone or otherwise higher-pH substrate.  They develop in basins, with some degree of groundwater seepage, where the higher pH and nutrient level are associated with a more diverse flora than that found in the typical acidic swamps of the region. The substrate is usually mineral soil, but there may be some peat.  Northern white cedar is a diagnostic tree and may dominate the canopy or be mixed with other conifers or with deciduous trees, most commonly red maple or black ash.  Some examples can be almost entirely deciduous and dominated by black ash.  Red-osier dogwood is a common shrub.  The moss layer is often extensive.
1	CONUS	207	207	01.C.3.D011M030E207	9214	Laurentian-Acadian Swamp Systems	This systems group includes coniferous to mixed swamps and adjacent sloping seepage forests in the temperate-boreal transition zone of the eastern half of the United States and adjacent Canada. They occupy basins and adjacent wet slopes in cool settings. The substrate is typically mineral soil with an organic fraction or peaty epipedon, in most cases constantly saturated. Basins may have seasonal standing water. Two expressions are characteristic, based on substrate pH and minerotrophy. In acidic and more nutrient-poor settings, Picea rubens or Picea mariana, Acer rubrum, Fraxinus spp., and Abies balsamea are the most typical trees. The herbaceous and shrub layers tend to be fairly species-poor, with Nemopanthus mucronatus and Osmunda spp. as typical shrub and herb species. In circumneutral settings or where seepage waters provide a greater supply of nutrients, Thuja occidentalis is characteristic and often dominant. It may be mixed with Acer rubrum, Fraxinus nigra, or Picea rubens (the latter especially in seepage slope forests). The herbaceous and bryophyte flora is typically extensive, and small open fenny areas may occur within the wetland. Peat may be well-developed in circumneutral basins (cedar swamps).
1	CONUS	208	208	01.C.3.D011M030E208	9914	North-Central Interior Wet Flatwoods	Northern flatwoods are found throughout the northern glaciated Midwest ranging east into Lower New England and the Champlain Valley. It usually occurs on poorly drained uplands or in depressions associated with glacial features such as tillplains, lakeplains or outwash plains. Soils often have an impermeable clay layer that can create a shallow, perched water table. Saturation can vary, with ponding common during wetter seasons, and drought possible during the summer and autumn months. These fluctuating moisture levels can lead to complexes of forest upland and wetland species occurring within this system. Pin oak dominates in many areas; other common trees include swamp white oak, bur oak, and/or red maple.  Areas with more dense tree cover have less shrub and herbaceous cover, while those with moderate tree canopy cover tend to have a dense understory. Flooding, drought and fire can influence this system.

This part of the Coastal Plain is referred to as the Jackson Purchase or ""Jackson Plain."" Flatwoods have long been recognized as a distinctive subdivision within this region (Davis 1923, Bryant and Martin 1988). Examples in the Pennyroyal Plain (of the western Interior Low Plateau) have been known for many years and referred to as ""pondywoods"" or ""crawfishy land"" (Chester et al. 1995). They are also known from the Shawnee Hills of Kentucky, on Periglacial lakebeds (M. Evans pers. comm. 2006), and from the Moulton Valley of Alabama (A. Schotz pers. comm. 2006). They tend to be confined to relatively small areas near the eastern flank of the region where loess deposits thin out. Unlike ~South-Central Interior / Upper Coastal Plain Flatwoods (CES203.479)$$ of the same general region (which is typified by complex microtopography), this system occupies broad flats underlain by fragipans. These fragipans impede the downward migration of water, resulting in wet conditions for portions of the year. Fire was an important natural process in this system, probably maintaining relatively open-canopied stands (M. Evans pers. comm.). Stands are dominated by hardwood trees, including oak spp., sweetgum, hickory spp., and red maple (Chester et al. 1995). Related wet flatwoods are apparently present in the Moulton Valley of Alabama and these are provisionally placed here."

Most known examples are seasonally flooded and consist of forests of wetland oaks, but a few are treeless or open-canopied ponds. Vegetation is zoned with an outer ring of trees, a more interior ring of shrubs, herbs and vines, and a central area with or without standing water year round depending on precipitation.

These streams have their headwaters in sandy portions of the Coastal Plain.  The water is usually strongly stained by tannins but has little suspended clay and is not turbid.  Depositional landforms may be absent or present only in limited variety and of small size.  Soils are usually strongly acidic.  Flooding ranges from semipermanent in the wettest floodplains to intermittent and short in higher gradient streams.  Some small blackwater streams have most of their flow from sandhill seepage and have limited fluctuation in water levels.  Vegetation consists almost entirely of forests of wetland trees.  Wetter examples are strongly dominated by Taxodium distichum and Nyssa biflora.  Other examples have mixtures of these species with Quercus spp. and other bottomland hardwoods tolerant of blackwater conditions.  Species richness ranges from low to moderate, but is lower than in comparable brownwater systems.  Flooding is an important ecological factor in this system and may be the most important factor separating it from adjacent systems.  Flooding brings nutrients and excludes non-flood-tolerant species.  Unlike river systems, flooding tends to be variable and of shorter duration.

It occurs on floodplains of smaller streams  where fine-textured sediment predominates, and that therefore carry substantial amounts of silt and clay. Depositional landforms, at least a natural levee, are often distinctly present but are fairly small relative to the scale of communities and help create some variation in duration of flooding and nutrient input. Soils are generally fertile and not strongly acidic. Flooding is generally seasonal but may range to nearly semipermanent. Vegetation consists almost entirely of forests of wetland trees. Wetter examples are strongly dominated by bald cypress and tupelo. Other examples have mixtures of these species with oaks and other bottomland hardwoods. Understory, shrub and herb layers are generally well-developed. Flooding is an important ecological factor in this system, bringing nutrients and excluding non-flood-tolerant species.

This system is restricted to narrow zones along upper tidal reaches of Inner Coastal Plain rivers and tributaries that have sufficient volumes of fresh water and short flooding to be able to support tree canopies. These areas are influenced by lunar tides of up to 3 feet, but freshwater flows from upstream dilute the salinity to a negligible level. Deciduous hardwood species predominate, includiing green ash, red maple, swamp tupelo, pumpkin ash, and occasionally (in Virginia) bald cypress.

In contrast to ~East Gulf Coastal Plain Large River Floodplain Forest (CES203.489)$$, it has fewer major geomorphic floodplain features typically associated with large river floodplains. Those features that are present tend to be smaller and more closely intermixed with one another, resulting in less obvious vegetational zonation. Bottomland hardwood tree species are typically important and diagnostic, although mesic hardwood species are also present in areas with less inundation, such as upper terraces and possibly second bottoms. As a whole, flooding occurs annually, but the water table usually is well below the soil surface throughout most of the growing season. Areas impacted by beaver impoundments are also included in this system.

It occurs from river's edge across the floodplain or to where it meets a wet meadow system. It can have a variety of soil types found within the floodplain from very well-drained sandy substrates to very dense clays. It is this variety of substrates and flooding that creates the mix of vegetation that includes Acer saccharinum, Populus deltoides, willows, especially Salix nigra in the wettest areas, and Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Ulmus americana, and Quercus macrocarpa in more well-drained areas. Within this system are oxbows that may support Nelumbo lutea and Typha latifolia. Understory species are mixed, but include shrubs, such as Cornus drummondii and Asimina triloba (in Kansas), sedges and grasses, which sometimes help form savanna vegetation. Flooding is the primary dynamic process, but drought, grazing, and fire have all had historical influence on this system. Federal reservoirs have had a serious and negative effect on this system, along with agriculture that has converted much of this system to drained agricultural land.

1	CONUS	226	226	01.C.3.D062M031E226	9854	Mississippi River Floodplain and Riparian Forest	This systems group comprises floodplain forests in the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain of the southeastern United States, from far southeastern Missouri and extreme southern Illinois south to the Gulf of Mexico, including the floodplains and terraces of the Mississippi River and the Red River (in Louisiana and eastern Texas). Within this area, it includes broad gradients of river size, soil nutrient levels, and flood frequency, including smaller tributaries. Flooding ranges from semipermanent in the wettest areas to intermittent and short on the higher portions of the floodplain. Some of the major geomorphic features associated with different community types include natural levees, point bars, meander scrolls, oxbows, and sloughs. Small river floodplain forests have fewer major geomorphic floodplain features typically associated with large river floodplains. Those features that are present tend to be smaller and more closely intermixed with one another, resulting in less obvious vegetational zonation. Large rivers have greater variation in water levels and have flood regimes that integrate the effects of very large watersheds. Depositional landforms are larger, and communities can be more segregated. Along the Mississippi River, low bottomlands are characteristic. These are seasonally flooded backswamps, with flooding usually more frequent than every two years, generally by still water that may be impounded behind natural levees. Vegetation generally includes forests dominated by bottomland hardwood species and other trees tolerant of flooding. However, herbaceous and shrub vegetation may be present in certain areas, particularly on recently deposited bars and in oxbow lakes. Most examples are nearly contiguous over large areas, broken only by the river itself. Higher terraces may have a mosaic of floodplain and upland systems, and may include nonriverine wetland systems. Some of the most typical and characteristic tree species found in stands of this systems group include Taxodium distichum, Nyssa aquatica, Acer saccharinum, Platanus occidentalis, Populus deltoides, Acer negundo, and Salix nigra. Other trees may include Celtis laevigata, Carya illinoinensis, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Gleditsia triacanthos, Liquidambar styraciflua, Nyssa biflora, Quercus laurifolia, Quercus lyrata, Quercus michauxii, Quercus nigra, Quercus pagoda, Quercus phellos, Quercus similis, Quercus texana, Quercus virginiana, Salix nigra, Ulmus americana, and Ulmus crassifolia. Three distinct groups of associations can be recognized. The lowest, wettest areas have some combination of Taxodium distichum and Nyssa aquatica dominating. Natural levees and riverfronts have a diverse mixture of trees that typically includes Platanus occidentalis, Celtis laevigata, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Acer saccharinum, Acer negundo, and other species that benefit from the high light levels and heavy alluvial deposition of these sites. Soils are typically sandier than those of the lower bottomlands. Arundinaria gigantea (giant cane) is a common understory in these forests on natural levees and higher point bars, and may become dominant after thinning or removal of the overstory. Willow and cottonwood sandbars may have an open-canopy (woodland-type) structure. Moderate to high parts of the floodplain away from the levee are usually dominated by bottomland hardwoods, various mixtures of wetland oaks, including Quercus laurifolia, Quercus michauxii, Quercus pagoda, and sometimes a number of other oak species, along with Liquidambar styraciflua or other species. The wettest forests can be simple in structure, with an understory but little shrub or herb layer; others tend to have well-developed subcanopy, shrub, and herb layers. Woody vines are usually prominent. Shrubs and small trees include Alnus serrulata, Arundinaria gigantea, Carpinus caroliniana, Cephalanthus occidentalis, Clethra alnifolia, Cornus foemina, Crataegus viridis, Forestiera acuminata, Ilex decidua, Itea virginica, Morella cerifera, Planera aquatica, Sabal minor, and Sebastiania fruticosa. Vines may include Berchemia scandens and Smilax bona-nox. Herbaceous species may include Boehmeria cylindrica, Carex complanata, Carex debilis, Carex intumescens, Carex joorii, Leersia virginica, Lycopus virginicus, Mikania scandens, Saccharum baldwinii, and Typha latifolia. Aquatic and floating herbs include Lemna minor, Nelumbo lutea, Nuphar lutea ssp. advena, and Nymphaea odorata.

Low bottomlands occur along the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain ecoregion. Prolonged flooding dominates this system, and its duration is greater that in the adjacent Mississippi River Riparian Forest. Overcup oak is the characteristic dominant species. Soils are clayey with poor internal drainage.

They are classed as Low Gradient Riverine Overbank wetlands in a hydrogeomorphic classification. Flooding is of lower duration than on adjacent backswamps where water is impounded behind riverfront natural levees. Flooding is of longer duration than on adjacent high bottomlands that are typically temporarily flooded. Soils are typically sandier than those of low bottomlands.

Several distinct plant communities can be recognized within this system that may be related to the array of different geomorphic features present within the floodplain. Some of the major geomorphic features associated with different community types within the system include natural levees, point bars, meander scrolls, oxbows, and sloughs (Sharitz and Mitsch 1993). Vegetation generally includes forests dominated by bottomland hardwood species and other trees tolerant of flooding, including bald-cypress and water tupelo. However, herbaceous and shrub vegetation may be present in certain areas as well. This system is generally similar in concept to ~West Gulf Coastal Plain Large River Floodplain Forest (CES203.488)$$ but is distinct from it because of the difference in magnitude between the typical large rivers (such as the Trinity, Neches, and Sabine), on the one hand, and the Mississippi River on the other. Its range is conceptually coincident with the vast majority of Subsection 234Ai of Keys et al. (1995), excluding the portion of 234Ai within TNC Ecoregion 42 (Mississippi River Alluvial Plain). Its range is also coincident with Level IV Ecoregion 35g (red River Bottomlands) of Omernik.
1	CONUS	230	230	01.C.3.D062M031E230	9852	Southern Coastal Plain Blackwater River Floodplain Forest	This system occurs along certain river and stream drainages of the southern Coastal Plain of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and southwestern Georgia that are characterized by dark waters high in particulate and dissolved organic materials, and that generally lack floodplain development. In most cases these are streams that have their headwaters in sandy portions of the Outer Coastal Plain. Consequently, they carry little mineral sediment or suspended clay particles and are not turbid except after the heaviest rain events. The water is classically dark in color due to concentrations of tannins, particulates, and other materials derived from drainage through swamps or marshes (FNAI 1990). In comparison with spring-fed rivers and brownwater rivers of the region, this system tends to be much more acidic in nature and generally lacks extensive and continuous floodplain and levees; steep banks alternating with floodplain swamps are more characteristic (FNAI 1990). This system includes mixed rivers, with a mixture of blackwater and spring-fed tributaries such as the Suwannee River. Canopy species typical of this system are obligate to facultative wetland species such as bald-cypress (bald-cypress), water tupelo (water tupelo), and Atlantic white-cedar (Atlantic white-cedar).

The vegetation includes both non-forested bar and scour communities and the more extensive forested floodplain communities. The forests of these smaller floodplains and bottomlands are not differentiated by depositional landforms such as levees, sloughs, ridges, terraces, and abandoned channel segments, because these features are small and flooding regimes are variable. The system is affected by flooding through wetness, scouring, deposition of material, and input of nutrients.

Examples may be found along large rivers of the West Gulf Coastal Plain and Upper West Gulf Coastal Plain, especially the Trinity, Neches, Sabine, and others. Several distinct plant communities can be recognized within this system that may be related to the array of different geomorphic features present within the floodplain. Some of the major geomorphic features associated with different community types include natural levees, point bars, meander scrolls, oxbows, and sloughs (Sharitz and Mitsch 1993).

Included are areas where the rivers enter bays and estuaries along the northern Gulf of Mexico that are somewhat tidally influenced.
1	CONUS	235	235	01.C.3.D062M031E235	9839	West Gulf Coastal Plain Small Stream and River Forest	This is a predominantly forested system of the West Gulf Coastal Plain associated with small rivers and creeks. In contrast to ~West Gulf Coastal Plain Large River Floodplain Forest (CES203.488)$$, examples of this system have fewer major geomorphic floodplain features. Those features that are present tend to be smaller and more closely intermixed with one another, resulting in less obvious vegetational zonation. Bottomland hardwood tree species are typically important and diagnostic, although mesic hardwood species are also present in areas with less inundation, such as upper terraces and possibly second bottoms. As a whole, flooding occurs annually, but the water table usually is well below the soil surface throughout most of the growing season. Areas impacted by beaver impoundments are also included in this system.

Examples are usually associated with ravines or along headwater streams. Overbank flooding is a negligible influence. Fire may be an important force in some and not in others. Vegetation consists of open to closed forest of acid-tolerant wetland hardwoods (sweetbay and swamp black gum typical) or pond pine. Generally there is a dense shrub layer consisting primarily of species shared with Atlantic Coastal Plain Peatland Pocosin and Canebrake, including inkberry, fetterbush, staggerbush, littleleaf titi, big gallberry, and honeycups.
1	CONUS	237	237	01.C.3.D062M032E237	9213	Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain Swamp Systems	This systems group consists of poorly drained, organic or mineral soil flats and basins of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains. These areas are saturated by rainfall and seasonal high water tables. Most are not associated with river floodplains, although one component system is a tidal swamp. Dominant tree species vary with geography. South of Virginia, Taxodium distichum and Nyssa spp. are the most characteristic trees in many of these swamps. In the North Atlantic Coastal Plain, Chamaecyparis thyoides, Acer rubrum, Liquidambar styraciflua, Nyssa sylvatica, Quercus phellos, and Fraxinus pennsylvanica are characteristic dominants. Tidal wooded swamps from Virginia to Florida are dominated by Taxodium, Nyssa, or Fraxinus. In the Mississippi River Valley, along with Taxodium distichum and Nyssa spp., characteristic trees include Acer rubrum, Carya aquatica, Fraxinus profunda, Gleditsia aquatica, Planera aquatica, Quercus lyrata, Quercus palustris, and Salix nigra. At the southern edge of this group's range, hydric hammocks in northern to central Florida are characterized by Chamaecyparis thyoides and Sabal palmetto. Important wetland oaks throughout much of the range include Quercus michauxii, Quercus pagoda, Quercus phellos, and Quercus laurifolia.
1	CONUS	238	238	01.C.3.D062M032E238	9838	Southern Coastal Plain Hydric Hammock	This system occupies flat lowlands along the southern and outermost portions of the Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States, usually over limestone substrates. Vegetation is characterized by mixed hardwood species (FNAI 1997), often with hydric oak species common (A. Johnson pers. comm.). In Florida examples of this system are often found adjacent to the floodplain of spring-fed rivers with relatively constant flows. In some areas, such as the Big Bend region, they occupy large areas of broad, shallow, mucky or seepy wetlands but generally do not receive overbank flooding (A. Johnson pers. comm.). In Alabama, this system is apparently confined to floodplains of the Mobile-Tensaw (A. Schotz pers. comm.), where examples are topographically higher than the surrounding floodplains.
1	CONUS	239	239	01.C.3.D062M032E239	9208	Southern Coastal Plain Seepage Swamp and Baygall	This wetland system consists of forested wetlands in acidic, seepage-influenced habitats of the East Gulf Coastal Plain, extending into central Florida. These are mostly evergreen forests generally found at the base of slopes or other habitats where seepage flow is concentrated. Resulting moisture conditions are saturated or even inundated. The vegetation is characterized by sweetbay and swamp blackgum. Examples occur in the outer portions of the Coastal Plain within the range of swampbay, and where sweetbay is an important or even dominant species. To the north this system grades into ~East Gulf Coastal Plain Northern Seepage Swamp (CES203.554)$$, where evergreen species are largely replaced by deciduous species in the canopy. Due to excessive wetness, these habitats are normally protected from fire except those which occur during extreme droughty periods. These environments are prone to long-duration standing water, and tend to occur on highly acidic, nutrient-poor soils.
1	CONUS	240	240	01.C.3.D062M032E240	9209	West Gulf Coastal Plain Seepage Swamp and Baygall	This West Gulf Coastal Plain ecological system consists of forested wetlands (often densely wooded) in acidic, seepage influenced wetland habitats. These wetlands may occur in poorly developed upland drainages, toe-slopes, and small headwaters stream bottoms. These environments are prone to long duration standing water, and tend to occur on highly acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The vegetation is characterized by sweetbay, blackgum, swamp blackgum, and red maple, although there is some variation according to latitude. Understory vegetation throughout the region consistently supports an abundance of ferns, such as cinnamon fern, royal fern, and netted chainfern. In most cases, these wetlands are embedded in uplands with deep sandy soils. When these communities are associated with streams, they tend to be low gradient, with narrow, often braided channels and diffuse drainage patterns. Due to excessive wetness, these habitats are normally protected from fire except those which occur during extreme droughty periods. The limited examples in Oklahoma are somewhat depauperate and lack some of the more southern and eastern taxa (e.g., sweetbay, swamp blackgum).

Its status and extent in this intervening terrain is unknown. Known examples in the Alabama/Mississippi parts of the range include a mosaic of open forests dominated by loblolly pine interspersed with patches of willow oak and sometimes other tree species. The ground surface displays an evident microtopography of alternating mounds and swales occurring in a tight local mosaic. These mounds are most likely ""gilgai"" (R. Wieland pers. comm.) resulting from vertic or shrink-swell properties of the Luinn soil series. Known examples display a range of moisture conditions from dry to wet. The wettest examples trap significant moisture from local rainfall events. These areas have ponded water for a minimum of several days at an interval and potentially for long periods of the year, especially when evapotranspiration is lowest. The vegetation of this system supports a relatively low vascular plant diversity and thus may appear floristically similar to other pine-hardwood vegetation of the region. The dry portion of this vegetational mosaic is dominated by grassy ground cover (longleaf wood-oats) with scattered emergent greenbriars (greenbrier spp.) underneath a nearly pure loblolly pine overstory. The historical composition of this type is unknown, but it seems likely that loblolly pine was a natural and even dominant component of this system, as it is in related systems in the West Gulf Coastal Plain (R. Evans pers. obs., T. Foti pers. comm.). Wetter areas are dominated by an overstory of willow oak with an abundance of dwarf palmetto in the understory.

It occurs primarily west of Crowley's Ridge on Pleistocene glacial outwash deposits in Arkansas and Missouri, and on Macon Ridge in Louisiana and adjacent Arkansas. The sites are above modern floodplains, but have poor internal drainage and are flat with poor runoff, leading to very wet conditions in winter and spring. They also often have a claypan that restricts both internal drainage and, later in the year, water availability. Therefore, they are very wet in the winter/spring and very dry in the summer, a moisture regime termed hydroxeric. Because of this moisture regime, the communities are variable, ranging from willow oak flats to post oak flats to prairies. In the 1940s, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission produced a wildlife habitat map of Arkansas in which these sites were classified as ""terrace hardwood forests."" These communities have a large variety of upland and lowland tree species, ranging from post oak to overcup oak in a small area. Such species diversity may be explained by regeneration of species with dramatically different moisture tolerances on the same site in dry and wet years on these hydroxeric sites. Because the sites are above current floodplains and susceptible to being drained, they have been cleared at an even greater rate than nearby floodplain forests."

Examples may be somewhat more common in the inland portions of the region but are also found in the Outer Coastal Plain as well. These areas are usually found on nonriverine, Pleistocene high terraces (EPA 35c). Soils are fine-textured, and hardpans may be present in the subsurface. The limited permeability of these soils contributes to perched water tables during fairly substantial portions of the year (when precipitation is greatest and evapotranspiration is lowest). Saturation occurs not from overbank flooding but typically whenever precipitation events occur. The local landscape is often a complex of ridges and swales, usually occurring in close proximity. There is vegetation variability related to soil texture and moisture and disturbance history. Most examples support hardwood forests or swamps, which are often heavily oak-dominated. Important species are tolerant of inundation. They include swamp chestnut oak, willow oak, diamondleaf oak, and sweetgum, with sparse coverage of wetland herbs such as southern waxy sedge. Some swales support unusual pockets of water ash and hawthorn spp. Some examples can contain loblolly pine.

These areas are usually found on nonriverine, Pleistocene high terraces. Soils are fine-textured, and hardpans may be present in the subsurface. The limited permeability of these soils contributes to shallowly perched water tables during portions of the year when precipitation is greatest and evapotranspiration is lowest. Soil moisture fluctuates widely throughout the growing season, from saturated to very dry, a condition sometimes referred to elsewhere as xerohydric. Saturation occurs not from overbank flooding but typically whenever precipitation events occur. Local topography is a complex of ridges and swales, often in close proximity to one another. Ridges tend to be much drier than swales, which may hold water for varying periods of time. Within both ridges and swales, there is vegetation variability relating to soil texture and moisture and disturbance history. The driest ridges support loblolly pine and post oak; more mesic ridges have loblolly pine with white oak and species such as horsesugar and southern arrow-wood.

1	CONUS	254	254	01.C.3.D062M161E254	9303	Atlantic Coastal Plain Clay-Based Carolina Bay Forested Wetland	This system consists of wetlands associated with ovoid, shallow depressions with nearly flat bottoms in parts of the Atlantic Coastal Plain.  Often called Carolina bays, these areas are most numerous and extensive in South Carolina but are also present in the Inner Coastal Plain of North Carolina.  The depressions have mineral soils with clay hardpans that trap and retain water from a combination of rainfall and exposure of a high regional water table.  Some examples are essentially permanently flooded, while others support water levels that  vary substantially from year to year and over longer climatic cycles.  Vegetation includes a series of primarily herbaceous and woodland associations.  The wettest sites have open water and floating-leaved aquatic vegetation, or marsh vegetation of tall graminoids. Drier sites often have an open canopy of Taxodium ascendens, with a dense, often fairly species-rich herbaceous layer beneath.  A few occurrences are shrubby, but none contain the dense shrub layers of characteristic pocosin species that occur in the bays with organic soils.  Vegetational composition often varies substantially from year to year, in response to differences in water levels and drawdown times.  Variation in hydroperiod is the most important dynamic, causing rapid major changes in the herbaceous vegetation.  Unlike the steeper-sided solution depressions, where many different hydroperiods are present within a short distance and vegetation zones simply shift, the flat-bottomed Carolina bays experience drastic yearly changes in hydroperiod over most of their extent.  Fire periodically spreads into the bays from adjacent uplands when conditions are dry, helps prevents invasion by less water-tolerant trees during dry periods, and interacts with flooding to affect vegetational composition.  Where fire is removed, Pinus taeda often invades the bays.  Fire may also be important in preventing buildup of organic matter on the soil surface.

Some examples are essentially permanently flooded, while others support water levels that vary substantially from year to year and over longer climatic cycles. Vegetation includes a series of primarily herbaceous and woodland associations. The wettest sites have open water and floating-leaved aquatic vegetation, or marsh vegetation of tall graminoids. Drier sites often have an open canopy of Taxodium ascendens, with a dense, often fairly species-rich herbaceous layer beneath. A few occurrences are shrubby, but none contain the dense shrub layers of characteristic pocosin species that occur in the bays with organic soils. Vegetational composition often varies substantially from year to year, in response to differences in water levels and drawdown times. Variation in hydroperiod is the most important dynamic, causing rapid major changes in the herbaceous vegetation. Unlike the steeper-sided solution depressions, where many different hydroperiods are present within a short distance and vegetation zones simply shift, the flat-bottomed Carolina bays experience drastic yearly changes in hydroperiod over most of their extent. Fire periodically spreads into the bays from adjacent uplands when conditions are dry, helps prevents invasion by less water-tolerant trees during dry periods, and interacts with flooding to affect vegetational composition. Where fire is removed, Pinus taeda often invades the bays. Fire may also be important in preventing buildup of organic matter on the soil surface.

This general area has been referred to as the Longleaf Pine Wiregrass Savannas region (Platt 1999) and the Sea Island Flatwoods Ecoregion (75f of Griffith et al. (2001, 2002)). Examples of this system and component community associations share the common features of wet, seasonally saturated, mineral soils and historic exposure to frequent low-intensity fire. They occur on a wide range of soil textures, which is an important factor in distinguishing different associations. The vegetation is naturally dominated by longleaf pine or, on wetter sites, slash pine or less commonly pond pine. Understory conditions may be dramatically altered by fire frequency and seasonality. In natural condition (frequent fires, including a growing-season component) there tends to be a dense ground cover of herbs and low shrubs; grasses can dominate, but there is often a large diversity of other herbs and shrubs.

It was once one of the most extensive systems in the coastward part of its range. It is characterized by wet, seasonally saturated, mineral soils and exposure to frequent fire. It occurs on a wide range of soil textures, which is an important factor in variation in cover and species. The vegetation is naturally dominated by pond pine. There is a dense ground cover of herbs and low shrubs; grasses dominate but there is often a large diversity of other herbs. Frequent, low-intensity fire is the dominant natural ecological force.
1	CONUS	258	258	01.C.3.D062M161E258	9909	Central Florida Pine Flatwoods	"This system is endemic to Florida, ranging in the north from approximately Levy and St. Johns counties (ca. 30 degrees N latitude) southward to approximately Hillsborough, Osceola and Polk counties. It was once an extensive system within its historic range. As currently conceived, this system includes both ""scrubby flatwoods"" that occur on well-drained soils and typical flatwoods that occur on more poorly drained soils. The vegetation is naturally dominated by either longleaf pine or slash pine, and less frequently includes pond pine. Examples vary in aspect from well-developed understory layers or scrub species to more herbaceous, savanna-like conditions. There is a dense ground cover of low shrubs, grasses, and herbs. Frequent, low-intensity fire is the dominant natural ecological force."

This range corresponds roughly to Ecoregion 75a (EPA 2004). These areas, often called ""flatwoods"" or ""flatlands,"" are subject to high fire-return intervals even though they are subject to seasonally high water tables. Overstory vegetation is characterized by longleaf pine and to a lesser degree by slash pine. Understory conditions range from densely shrubby to open and herbaceous-dominated, based largely upon fire history. Fire is naturally frequent, with a fire-return time of from one to four years."

1	CONUS	262	262	01.C.3.D062M161E262	9905	South Florida Pine Flatwoods	This system is endemic to Florida, ranging from approximately Lee, Desoto, Highlands, and Okeechobee counties southward. It was once an extensive system within its historic range. The vegetation is naturally dominated by south florida slash pine, being largely outside the natural range of pond pine, slash pine, and longleaf pine. In natural condition, examples are generally open with a variety of low shrub and grass species forming a dense ground cover. Frequent, low-intensity fire was the dominant natural ecological force, but most areas have undergone long periods of fire suppression resulting in greater dominance of shrubs and saw palmetto, as well as denser canopies of slash pine (Huffman and Judd 1998, Noel et al. 1998).
1	CONUS	263	263	01.C.3.D062M161E263	9703	Southern Coastal Plain Nonriverine Cypress Dome	This system consists of small forested wetlands, typically dominated by pond-cypress, with a characteristic and unique dome-shaped appearance in which trees in the center are higher than those around the sides (Monk and Brown 1965). Examples are known from the Southern Coastal Plain (Omernik Ecoregion 75 and adjacent 65) (EPA 2004) of Florida and Georgia, extending into Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. Examples occupy poorly drained depressions which are most often embedded in a matrix of pine flatwoods. The oldest and largest individual trees typically occupy the center of these domed wetlands, with smaller and younger individuals around the margins. Pools of stagnant, highly acidic water may stand in the center of these depressions ranging from 1-4 feet in depth, but becoming increasingly shallow along the margins. These sites are underlain by an impervious clay pan which impedes drainage and traps precipitation. Some examples may have thick (50-100 cm) organic layers. In addition to pond-cypress, other woody species may include swamp blackgum, Chapman's St. John's-wort, myrtleleaf St. John's-wort, myrtle dahoon, swamp doghobble, wax-myrtle, common buttonbush, sweetgum, coastal sweet-pepperbush, shining fetterbush, and downy snowbell.
1	CONUS	264	264	01.C.3.D062M161E264	9908	West Gulf Coastal Plain Wet Longleaf Pine Savanna and Flatwoods	This system was the historical matrix vegetation of the outer portions of the West Gulf Coastal Plain in Louisiana and eastern Texas, occurring most frequently on relatively recent geologic formations within the range of longleaf pine. These areas are characterized by poorly drained upland soils with high water tables (Bridges and Orzell 1990). In natural condition, monospecific stands of longleaf pine and species-rich herbaceous layers characterize this system. Widespread alterations following European settlement, including changes to natural fire regimes, have produced drastic changes to this system, and few large examples are extant. Examples appear to be somewhat more common in western Louisiana than eastern Texas.

Found along major rivers to small streams, they range from large bottomland gallery  forests, to a small shrublands lining streams in a narrow valleys, at low elevations of mountian foothills.  Isolated cottonwoods and Ponderosa pine are often present, with western birch, willows, hawthorn, or white alder dominant. Patches of sedge meadows or wet grasslands sometimes occur within these streamside habitats.
1	CONUS	266	266	01.C.3.D012M034E266	9830	Great Basin Foothill and Lower Montane Riparian Woodland and Shrubland	These are riparian woodlands and shrublands found in the foothills and mountains of the Great Basin and eastern Sierra Nevada.

This lush vegetation occurs on stream banks, adjacent floodplains, and can occur on in-stream islands, and sand or cobble bars.  It can form large, wide occurrences along larger rivers or narrow bands on small, rocky canyon tributaries and well-drained benches. It is also typically found in backwater channels and other perennially wet but less scoured sites, such as floodplains swales and irrigation ditches.  Hardwood trees and tall shrubs (cottonwood, maple, alder, western birch, creek dogwood and willow species), conifers (Douglas-fir, spruce or Ponderosa pine) dominate most sites, with a diverse understory of low shrubs (rose, snowberry), wildflowers and grasses.

Trees includes subalpine fir, Douglas-fir and Engelmann spruce,  aspen, cottonwood, and mountain alder, with diverse shrubs and wildflowers in the understory.  This includes streamside forests and woodlands that occur in narrow stream borders in steep, V-shaped valleys and canyons, to broader floodplains in wide valley bottoms.
1	CONUS	273	273	01.C.3.D012M035E273	9306	North Pacific Hardwood-Conifer Swamp	These are mixed hardwood - conifer wetlands and swamps, which occur as fairly small patch sites in the forests of Oregon and Washington, but become much more extensive to the north, until becoming quite abundant in southeastern Alaska.  They occur in river valleys, and around the edges of lakes and large marshes, occasionally occuring on wet slopes.  As with most wetlands, they are flooded at least part of the year.  This system is extremely variable, including mixed Oregon Ash - conifer forests from Willamette Valley floor, coastal swamps, and hardwood-conifer swamps found at high elevations in the Cascades.
1	CONUS	274	274	01.C.3.D012M035E274	9811	North Pacific Lowland Riparian Forest and Shrubland	These are low elevation (not in the mountains) river and creek-side forest, woodland and shrubland habitats found in the Pacific Northwest.  It includes black cottonwood gallery forests, hardwood forests of red and white alder, Oregon ash and bigleaf maple, and diverse willow shrublands or woodlands.  Most examples are narrow and linear in character, occurring on floodplains or lower terraces of rivers and streams. Where the river banks are steep, and the stream bed itself is steep, the stream side forest will be quite narrow. But where the stream is not steep, and meanders back and forth across a broad valley, the forest may be quite wide and interspersed with tall willow clumps as well as cottonwood trees. These communities like to keep their feet wet and are adapted to flooding, and the damage that may occur with big floods, such as scour and deposition. Cottonwood and willows actually depend on new deposits of sand and gravel  for germination.

It occurs on steep streams and narrow floodplains above foothills but below the tree-less alpine environments. Surrounding habitats include subalpine parklands and montane forests.  Dominant species include lodgepole pine, black cottonwood, white fir, California red fir, quaking aspen and several different kinds of alder, current, goosberry, and willow. These forests and tall shrublands like to keep their feet wet and are adapted to flooding, and the damage that may occur with big floods, such as scour and deposition. Cottonwood and willows actually depend on new deposits of sand and gravel  for germination. Forests along streambanks can be quite different from the adjacent forest  because of its shrubby or more deciduous character.

It occurs on the floodplains of small to large rivers of California's Central Valley.  Important trees and shrubs include Fremont cottonwood, California sycamore, valley oak, Goodding's willow, box-elder, common buttonbush and California grape. Herbaceous components can include Santa barbara sedge, Douglas' wormwood, and various marsh species such as giant bulrush and cattails along riverbanks and in backwater areas. Black walnut, Tree-of-Heaven and tamarisk are problem invasive woody species. Periodic flooding and associated sediment scour are necessary to maintain growth and reproduction of vegetation. Flooding regimes have been significantly altered in all but a few tributaries that support this system.

1	CONUS	285	285	01.D.1.D014M037E285	4201	Boreal Aspen-Birch Forest	Aspen-birch forests are  early-successional boreal hardwood forests and woodlands  widespread throughout boreal Canada and extend into the northern United States in northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northern Michigan.  They can occur in a variety of upland settings.  They originate naturally after fires and blowdowns, but more commonly originate after logging of conifer or mixed conifer-hardwood forests. Quaking aspen and paper birch are the most important tree species.  Pines and spruce can occur but are scattered or abundant only in small  areas.  Other common hardwoods are bigtooth aspen, red maple, and, in wetter areas, balsam poplar.  This aspen-birch forest is maintained by repeated disturbance within 50-year return intervals and would otherwise succeed to conifer systems.
1	CONUS	286	286	01.D.1.D014M037E286	4535	Boreal Jack Pine-Black Spruce Forest	Jack pine-black spruce forests can be found from the upper Midwest and Canada to a limited region of northwestern Maine and New Hampshire.  These forests often cover large areas.  Soils are nutrient-poor and loamy to sandy, varying from thin soil over bedrock to deeper soils. Jack pine is the characteristic overstory tree, occurring with black spruce and/or red pine. Paper birch and aspen may also be present, especially if the area has been disturbed by fire or logging.  Shrub cover can vary from sparse to dense.  Blueberries and other low shrubs are are most common.  A layer of feathermosses is typical on the ground.
1	CONUS	287	287	01.D.1.D014M037E287	4326	Boreal White Spruce-Fir-Hardwood Forest	This forest occurs on the southern edge of the boreal forest, ranging from eastern Alberta to eastern Canada and southward into Minnesota and the Great Lakes region.  It is widespread in much of its range and  can dominate the landscape.  Soils are acidic and usually rocky, and range from well-drained to somewhat poorly drained.  The low-elevation forests are typified by white spruce and balsam fir. Black spruce is often present, along with occasional jack pine. Common to abundant boreal hardwoods include quaking aspen and paper birch. Other hardwoods are relatively minor. This forest system may include earlier successional patches, in which aspen and birch are dominant or mixed with spruce and fir, that will develop into spruce-fir forests. Blowdowns with subsequent gap regeneration are the most frequent form of natural disturbance, with large-scale fires important at longer return intervals.
1	CONUS	288	288	01.D.2.D016M299E288	9501	Boreal Acidic Peatland Systems	"This systems group includes peatlands that are found at the near-boreal latitudes of the northeastern and north-central United States and adjacent Canada, where climate allows the rate of peat accumulation to exceed its decomposition, resulting in acidic peatlands. They vary from ombrotrophic to weakly minerotrophic, often within the same peatland, with various arrangements of raised bog (ombrotrophic) and poor fen (minerotrophic) portions; most are at least partly ombrotrophic. The surface morphology of the bog may be more-or-less level, domed, or eccentric, but typically is over the water table. A maritime version along the north Atlantic Coast south to easternmost Maine develops distinctive raised plateaus when occurring in basins, or occurs as a ""blanket bog"" over a sloping rocky substrate in extreme maritime settings. The vegetation physiognomy varies from forest to low-shrub dominance, often with patches of graminoids and bryophyte lawns. The maritime bogs are almost always non-forested and often feature lawns of Trichophorum caespitosum. In settings where trees form a partial to moderate cover, stunted (or less frequently well-developed) Picea mariana and Larix laricina are the dominant trees, and dwarf-shrubs (Chamaedaphne calyculata, Ledum groenlandicum) and sedges are common in the understory. Dwarf-shrub-dominated areas are dominated by low ericaceous shrubs (including Kalmia angustifolia, Kalmia polifolia, Ledum groenlandicum, Chamaedaphne calyculata, and, near the coast, Empetrum nigrum and Gaylussacia dumosa), with patches of stunted conifers. In the raised portions, secondary bog pools may be present. These peatlands are sometimes referred to as a ""muskeg,"" a flat boggy peatland with scattered trees and a fairly dense shrub layer on mounded or hummocky peat."
1	CONUS	289	289	01.D.2.D016M300E289	9815	Eastern Boreal Floodplain	These southern boreal floodplains are found in the extreme northern portions of the eastern U.S., and believed to be more widespread in Canada. They consist of flat floodplains along northern rivers, in depositional areas not strongly influenced by ice-scour, where topography and process have resulted in a complex of upland and wetland alluvial vegetation. This complex includes floodplain forests dominated by northern trees such as balsam poplar and black ash, as well as herbaceous sloughs and shrub wetlands. (Silver maple is uncommon or absent.) Most areas are underwater each spring; microtopography determines how long the various habitats are inundated. The distribution in the U.S. appears to be primarily Canadian, with incursions into northern Maine and northern Minnesota.

The vegetation is poorly known but apparently includes at least one endemic species, Garber's sandmat. Other diagnostic species may include Jamaica-dogwood and blackbead.
1	CONUS	291	291	02.A.3.D095M287E291	3115	Southeast Florida Beach	This beach ecological system is the southernmost of its kind along the mainland coast of North America. Its southerly location distinguishes it from other types along the Atlantic Coast, primarily due to the prevalence of the tropical flora it supports. This type is related to ~Southwest Florida Beach (CES411.276)$$ but is affected directly by much higher wave energy from the Atlantic. This region has some of the highest wave energy along the entire Atlantic Coastal Plain (Tanner 1960).
1	CONUS	292	292	02.A.3.D095M287E292	3120	Southwest Florida Beach	This system ranges from Anclote Key southward to Cape Romano (Johnson and Barbour 1990). Within the northern Gulf region these beaches are distinguished by the highest species richness, greatest cover of succulents, and high cover of dune marsh-elder and several tropical species (Barbour et al. 1987). Sands are relatively coarse and, unlike other beach systems of the northern Gulf of Mexico, are extremely rich in calcium from an abundance of calcareous shell fragments.
1	CONUS	293	293	02.A.5.D018M041E293	9219	South Florida Everglades Sawgrass Marsh	"This marsh system was a dominant type throughout much of the Everglades region of southeastern Florida. It consists largely of herbaceous marsh vegetation across a range of soil and hydrologic conditions, but generally falls within conditions outlined by Duever et al. (1986), i.e., hydroperiod of 225-275 days per year, maximum wet-season water level of 40 cm., and occurrence on peat soils. Several individual marsh community associations have been recognized based on species composition, structure, and aspect. Variations are largely due to the interrelated effects of fire, soils, and hydroperiod. Sawgrass beds or ""glades"" may have been the single most extensive component of this system (Hilsenbeck et al. 1979), and large areas may have the appearance of nearly monotypic stands of sawgrass. However, local variation in composition and stature are also often apparent. For example, two broad aspect types of sawgrass marsh are often recognized based on density and/or height (Kushlan 1990, Gunderson and Loftus 1993) with denser and taller stands typically occurring on higher topographic positions and deeper organic soils, while sparser, shorter stands occur in lower topography on shallower soils. In addition, other marsh types are also interfingered in the sawgrass matrix where wetter depressions are found and/or where fires have burned away peat soils."
1	CONUS	294	294	02.A.5.D018M041E294	9718	South Florida Freshwater Slough and Gator Hole	This system includes a series of wetlands of southern Florida, ranging in physiognomy from open and herbaceous-dominated to tree-dominated patches, including nearly monospecific stands of Carolina willow (Davis 1943, Loveless 1959, Craighead 1971). These wetlands hold water for much of the year and have some of the longest hydroperiods (8-12 months) in a region characterized by wetlands. Most are maintained, at least historically, by American alligators. Alligators were such a dominant disturbance force in many plant communities of south Florida that their role has been compared with that of bison in the prairies (Craighead 1971). Through constant movement, they create numerous small pools and ponds (analogous to buffalo wallows) as well as trails to and from these pools through sawgrass marshes. These paths eventually widen and deepen into creeks. Many of these small freshwater creeks have been invaded by mangroves and hardwoods, including Carolina willow, in the absence of fire and with decreases in alligator populations (Craighead 1971). Some emergent wetlands included within the concept of this system may also have originated from soil and topographic changes in former sawgrass marshes following severe fires that consume organic substrate and decrease soil elevation (Gunderson and Loope 1982b). One component of this system (&#8243; heads&#8243; may originate as circular or oval-shaped solution holes or basins, being maintained and possibly enhanced by the alligator activity. Without this activity, there would be a tendency for the hole or basin to fill with organic material and succeed to other systems. Soils are mucky peats. In addition, Carolina willow seeds are readily dispersed by wind and may rapidly colonize wet depressions and disturbed areas. In the absence of fire and disturbance, these areas may remain in a forested condition. Otherwise, they would cycle between different physiognomic states, including sawgrass marsh.
1	CONUS	295	295	02.A.5.D018M041E295	9602	South Florida Wet Marl Prairie	This system includes marl prairies of the southern Florida Everglades region and related vegetation of the Florida Keys. This system occurs only on shallower soils with bedrock close to the surface (Gunderson and Loftus 1993). Composition and variability in this system is heavily influenced by hydrology, with the predominant community types occurring on seasonally flooded (3-7 months per year) soils; with diminished hydroperiod species composition changes (Hilsenbeck et al. 1979). Possibly the most unique vegetational component are small-patch communities found on elevated areas of oolitic rocks referred to as pinnacle rock (Gunderson and Loftus 1993) or table rock (Hilsenbeck et al. 1979). This system also includes embedded solution holes (depressions formed from limestone collapse).
1	CONUS	296	296	02.B.1.D020M043E296	5401	California Maritime Chaparral	This chaparral shrubland occurs in patches restricted to sands, sandstones, other marine sediments, and stabilized sand dunes within the fog belt throughout the central and northern California coast.  It is characterized by a combination manzanita and Ceanothus, which are species that reproduce by seed rather than resprouting. Depending on the location, a different endemic manzanita species is the dominant shrub, but chamise, black sage, California coffeeberry, holly leaf buckthorn and coast live oak are often also present. Stands can be very dense with little to no herbaceous undergrowth, or more open with grasses inbetween shrubs. Controlled burns have resulted in poor survivorship of manzanita  species and scientists believe they need long fire-free intervals, so that many seeds may build up in the soil over time, creating what is called a  viable seedbank, that will be the source of new shrubs following fire.
1	CONUS	297	297	02.B.1.D020M043E297	5402	California Mesic Chaparral	This rich chaparral  occurs on mesic sites such as north-facing slopes, concavities, or bottom of slopes throughout coastal California but inland from  coastal fog belt. It occurs mostly on north-facing slopes up to 1500 m (4550 feet) in elevation and up to 1830 m (6000 feet) in southern California. It is dominated by a variety of mixed or single-species, that are evergreen and  sclerophyllous (thick-leaved and drought resistant) shrubs that resprout from thick roots following fire. Common species include scrub oak, scrub interior live oak, birchleaf mountain-mahogany, California ash, silktassel, toyon, honeysuckle, hollyleaf cherry, hollyleaf buckthorn, and hollyleaf redberry. Most chaparral species are fire-adapted, resprouting vigorously after burning or producing fire-resistant seeds. However, this is not a system that requires frequent fire for perpetuation.
1	CONUS	298	298	02.B.1.D020M043E298	5404	California Xeric Serpentine Chaparral	This ecological system occurs throughout Mediterranean California  on thin, rocky,  serpentinite soils. Serpentine soil can have very low Calcium to Magnesium ratios, which  impacts biotic composition. This system is highly variable and spotty in distribution. Characteristic plant species include McNab cypress, leather oak, whiteleaf manzanita, Mexican manzanita, and bigberry manzanita. Common associates include common chamise, sedgeleaf buckbrush, California flannelbush, deer oak, huckleberry oak, silktassel spp., California laurel, Siskiyou-mat, California coffeeberry, and pinemat manzanita. California endemics such as muskbush also occur. Foothill pine can merely present to abundant. Many locally endemic and rare wildflowers  can occur, such as twistflower spp., dwarf-flax spp., buckwheat spp., tarweed spp., monkeyflower spp., onion spp., and serpentine milkweed. This chaparral type tends to have fewer trees than mesic chaparral.
1	CONUS	299	299	02.B.1.D020M043E299	5516	Klamath-Siskiyou Xeromorphic Serpentine Savanna and Chaparral	Serpentine savannas, found in areas that are wet enough to support forests and woodlands, with the rocky, mineralized soils keeping the sites open.  Usually found on river terraces, lower mountain slopes, and ridgetops, often with southern exposures.   These are grasslands or open chaparral shrublands with isolated Jeffrey pine or occasionally knobcone pine trees. Grasses and exceptionally diverse forbs dominate the understory, with variable shrubs.
1	CONUS	300	300	02.B.1.D020M043E300	4404	Mediterranean California Mesic Serpentine Woodland and Chaparral	This ecological system occurs in Mediterranean California in the north and south Coast Ranges and the northern Sierra Nevada, on cool northerly  slopes and toeslopes with thin, rocky, serpentinite soils. Serpentine soil can have very low Calcium to Magnesium ratio, which  impacts biotic composition. Sargent cypress, foothill pine, chaparral silktassel, leather oak, California laurel, and California coffeeberry are characteristic. Common associates include toyon, common chamise, and the California endemics sticky whiteleaf manzanita and muskbush. Common herbs can include Torrey's melicgrass, Idaho fescue, iris spp., and locally endemic serpentine wildflowers. Structurally, this system is sometimes like a woodland, and can be dense very tall, nearly tree-like chaparral,  depending on fire history.
1	CONUS	301	301	02.B.1.D020M043E301	5408	Northern and Central California Dry-Mesic Chaparral	This open chaparral shrubland is found  inland from maritime chaparral up to 1500 m 4550 feet in elevation, in interior valleys and their margins, from northern California through the northern end of the Central Valley and north into Oregon.  A mix of drought deciduous and evergreen chaparral species, including common chamise, buckbrush, several manzanita species, California flannelbush, bushmallow, bush poppy, and stingaree-bush. In Oregon, it is characterized by buckbrush and manzanita, usually with bunchgrass understories.  These chaparral shrublands usually occur in and around larger patches of oak savannas, woodlands and mixed hardwood - conifer woodlands. Fires are intense, the shrubs reseed after fire, so it is considered a fire-adapted shrubland..
1	CONUS	302	302	02.B.1.D020M043E302	5410	Southern California Dry-Mesic Chaparral	This ecological system includes chaparral from sea level up to 1500 m (4550 feet) elevation throughout central and southern California and inland portions of Baja Norte, Mexico. It is found in dry-mesic to mesic site conditions analogous to mesic chaparral. Santa Ana winds drive late-summer, stand-replacing fires in these systems. Characteristic species include bigpod ceanothus, hoaryleaf ceanothus, chaparral whitethorn, Mojave Desert whitethorn, common chamise, redshank, bigberry manzanita, birchleaf mountain-mahogany, smooth mountain-mahogany, sugarbush, and mission manzanita.
1	CONUS	303	303	02.B.1.D020M044E303	5210	Southern California Coastal Scrub	This mixed coastal shrubland occurs from central California south into Baja Norte, Mexico. It is composed of drought-deciduous shrubs such as California sagebrush, black sage, white sage, purple sage, California brittlebush, and California wild buckwheat.  Also present  are fire-tolerant evergreen shrubs, laurel sumac, lemonade sumac, and hollyleaf buckthorn. Recent increases in the number of fires have converted many of these shrublands to non-native, annual grasslands.  Abundance of fire-tolerant shrubs, and coastal prickly-pear have increased in many areas.
1	CONUS	304	304	02.B.2.D021M045E304	7501	California Central Valley and Southern Coastal Grassland	This system is found from 10-1200 m (30-3600 feet) elevation; receiving on average 50 cm (range 25-100 cm) of precipitation per year, mainly as winter rain. It is found with fine-textured soils, moist or even waterlogged in winter, but very dry in summer. Historically, these grasslands were common among oak savanna and woodland and probably experienced similar frequent fire regimes. Characteristic plant species include purple needlegrass, threeawn spp., boreal yarrow, blow-wives, annual goat-chicory, common goldenstar, prettyface, wavyleaf soap-plant, winecup fairyfan, tall mountain shootingstar, blue wild rye, beardless lyme grass, California fescue, California melicgrass, attenuate Indian-paintbrush, and curly bluegrass.
1	CONUS	305	305	02.B.2.D021M045E305	7401	California Mesic Serpentine Grassland	These grasslands are of very limited distribution in California within the Coast Ranges, Sierra Nevada, and Transverse Ranges on deep soils with serpentine-rich parent material. Serpentine soils can have  very low Calcium to Magnesium ratio that  impacts the  biotic composition.  In this system, native perennial grass dominates, though typically in less dense cover than other grassland  types. Characteristic species include serpentine reedgrass, California poppy, Eastwood's fescue, curly bluegrass, hayfield tarweed, nodding needlegrass, and purple needlegrass. Historic fire regimes in this system are not well known.
1	CONUS	306	306	02.C.1.D022M048E306	7304	Columbia Basin Foothill and Canyon Dry Grassland	These dry grasslands of the inland Pacific Northwest are found on steep canyons and foothill slopes.  The grasslands are composed of bunchgrasses that are often open or patdhy especially on steep sites with rocky or gravelly soils.. Bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and panhandle prickly-pear are common species. Occasional deciduous shrubs may be present such as snowberry, oceanspray, serviceberry and currant.
1	CONUS	307	307	02.C.1.D022M048E307	7307	Columbia Basin Palouse Prairie	This lush bunchgrass prairie occurs on deep, productive soils in eastern Washington and Oregon, and west-central Idaho.  Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass are the most abundant grasses with needle-and-thread, Scribner's needlegrass, giant wildrye, great basin lyme grass, or curly bluegrass. Scattered shrubs may be present such as Saskatoon serviceberry, common snowberry, and black hawthorn.  Massive conversion to agriculture has reduced this once-extensive grassland to remnant patches that are now typically associated with steep and rocky sites. Invasion from exotic grasses cheatgrass or Kentucky bluegrass also threaten it.
1	CONUS	308	308	02.C.1.D022M048E308	7104	North Pacific Alpine and Subalpine Dry Grassland	These are high elevation, dry meadows, particularly south-facing slopes, typically imbedded in or above subalpine forests and woodlands.   They are dominated by bunchgrasses, most commonly fescues green, alpine, Idaho, and Roemer, often with an early season wildflower component.
1	CONUS	309	309	02.C.1.D022M048E309	7202	North Pacific Montane Grassland	These are relatively large areas of dry mountain meadows in the Cascade Mountians of Oregon and in the Sierra Nevada of California and Nevada.  They can be found up to 3500 m (10,300 feet)  in elevation. They occur in openings of mountain forests, along ridgelines and other exposed mountain-top areas, where soils are deeper than forest soils and are well drained.   Native 'bunchgrasses' that form dense clumps at their base, along with other native grasses tend to cover the ground.  Common grasses include wildrye, Idaho fescue and nodding needlegrass. A few wildflowers are present and form accents to the surrounding  sea of grass.  Occasionally there might be a single conifer tree in the meadow, separate from the surrounding forest.
1	CONUS	310	310	02.C.1.D022M048E310	5804	North Pacific Montane Shrubland	These are often dense shrublands found scattered in small to occasionally large patches in the coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest.  They are usually created by fire or other disturbance, but the shrubs can persist for decades or more, usually on the dry ridgetops, exposed south slopes or rocky sites where they are established.  Deciduous tall shrubs vine maple, serviceberry, and huckleberry, evergreen shrubs snowbush, and wildflowers beargrass are the most common species.
1	CONUS	311	311	02.C.1.D022M048E311	7203	Northern Rocky Mountain Lower Montane, Foothill and Valley Grassland	These low to mid elevation grasslands found in the mountains and valleys of the northwestern US and extend southeast in to the middle Rocky Mountains where the climate (predominately winter moisture) favors certain grasses. Common grasses are large bunchgrasses (bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie fescue, Idaho fescue, or needle-and-thread) often with scattered (usually deciduous) shrubs and a diverse range of forbs.
1	CONUS	312	312	02.C.1.D022M048E312	5808	Northern Rocky Mountain Montane-Foothill Deciduous Shrubland	These shrublands are often found on foothill, lower mountain and canyon slopes in the Columbia Plateau and northern Rocky Mountains.  They vary from dense shrubs to open shrub - bunchgrass habitats. Tall deciduous shrubs such as ninebark, hawthorn, mock-orange, smooth sumac, and serviceberry with grasses like  fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, pinegrass and elk sedge.  They sometimes occur near open Ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir woodlands, sometimes higher in the mountains near larch or true fir.  While found on all aspects, they are usually on fairly steep slopes or toeslopes.  In areas that received heavy livestock grazing, introduced  Kentucky bluegrass and timothy are often common.
1	CONUS	313	313	02.C.1.D022M048E313	5812	Northern Rocky Mountain Subalpine Deciduous Shrubland	High mountain shrublands in the northern Rocky Mountains that are often dominated by various deciduous shrubs. Fool's-huckleberry, alderleaf buckthorn, bristly black currant, thimbleberry, Cascade azalea, Sitka mountain-ash, and whortleberry are common shrubs, which occur with forbs such as iris, braken fern and fireweed. These shrublands occur on sites with shallow, moist soils that either burn too frequently or are otherwise poor habitat for trees.  However, avalanches do not occur repeatly on these sites.
1	CONUS	314	314	02.C.1.D022M048E314	7204	Northern Rocky Mountain Subalpine-Upper Montane Grassland	These mountain grasslands occur at higher elevations in the Canadian Rockies, extending south to eastern Oregon, Idaho and western Montana. They are found on ridges and often dryer south facing slopes ranging form small isolated patches to parklands, or more extensive dry grasslands. Lush grass cover appears to limit tree seedling growth with occasional fires also killing tree seedlings. Bunchgrasses such as fescues and needlegrasses are most common and include prairie fescue, Idaho fescue, greenleaf fescue, western needlegrass, and Richardson's needlegrass.  A variety of sedges, such as Hood's sedge, blunt sedge, and scirpus-like sedge and herbs like  spur lupine, mountain meadow cinquefoil, Virginia strawberry, and fireweed are often present.
1	CONUS	315	315	02.C.1.D022M048E315	7206	Southern Rocky Mountain Montane-Subalpine Grassland	These are grasslands found at mid- to high-elevations in the central and southern Rocky Mountains, mixed with spruce-fir, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine and quaking aspen forests. Places they occur are flat to rolling plains and intermountain 'parks' (large treeless valleys within the forested mountains)  or on lower sideslopes that are dry. The soils of these areas resemble soils found in midwestern prairies, being high in organic matter and usually slightly acidic.  The predominant plants are grasses, which grow in dense clumps, mixed with wildflowers. Some important grass species include timber oatgrass, Parry's oatgrass, Idaho fescue, Arizona fescue, Thurber's fescue, slim-stem muhly, mountain muhly, or bluebunch wheatgrass.  Many species of upland birds utilize these grasslands for forage and nesting habitat.
1	CONUS	316	316	02.C.1.D022M049E316	5809	Rocky Mountain Gambel Oak-Mixed Montane Shrubland	Gambel oak shrublands occur in the mountains, plateaus and foothills of the southern Rocky Mountains and Colorado Plateau. They are most commonly found along dry foothills, lower mountain slopes, and at the edge of the western Great Plains, and are often situated above pinyon-juniper woodlands. Gambel oak is the predominant shrub, but other deciduous shrubs (lose their leaves in winter) include serviceberry, basin big sagebrush, mountain-mahogany, choke cherry, Stansbury's cliffrose, antelope bitterbrush, New Mexico locust, or snowberry. Fire typically plays an important role in this system, causing die-back of the shrubs in some areas, promoting stump sprouting of shrubs in other areas, and controlling the invasion of trees into the shrubland system. Natural fires often result in a mosaic of dense shrub clusters and openings dominated by herbs and grasses.
1	CONUS	317	317	02.C.1.D022M049E317	5806	Rocky Mountain Lower Montane-Foothill Shrubland	These widespread shrublands are found in the foothills, canyons  and lower elevation mountains slopes in the Rocky Mountains and on hills and canyon slopes in the western Great Plains. They  are found on exposed, rocky and dry sites that limit tree growth, although scattered juniper or ponderosa pine trees may be present. Mountain-mahogany shrubs are especially common in foothills in the Colorado Front Range, and north in Wyoming or south in New Mexico, however a mixture of dry shrubs including Utah serviceberry, antelope bitterbrush, or mountain snowberry may be present. Gambel oak is generally absent.  Natural fires play an important role in this system as many of the shrubs require a disturbance such as fire to reproduce.  With less frequent burning shrubs become larger and grasses become less abundant.
1	CONUS	318	318	02.C.1.D022M050E318	7502	California Northern Coastal Grassland	This ecological system is found in discontinuous patches below 300 m (1000 feet) elevation from San Francisco Bay north into Oregon on coastal terraces and ridgeline balds in the Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains. It occurs in areas that receive more rainfall than other California grasslands of the interior or southern coastal California. In recent centuries, these were wild fire-dominated systems, as well as Native American use of fire in these areas. While still present, annuals herbs are not as prevalent in these grasslands as elsewhere in California. With fire suppression, coyotebrush and other shrub components of north coastal scrub often invade and can replace these grasslands with scrub-dominated systems. Bentgrass., California brome, Pacific reedgrass, California oatgrass, red fescue, Idaho fescue, tall false oats, and perennial wildflowers such as mountain iris, California blue-eyed-grass, hairy gumweed, and footsteps-of-spring are characteristic.
1	CONUS	319	319	02.C.1.D022M050E319	7604	North Pacific Herbaceous Bald and Bluff	These are grass and forb dominated cliffs, bluffs and grass balds which are common in the interior valleys and the lower mountains of western Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.  They are dominated by grasses and diverse wildflowers, often moss rich, and occur as openings in a conifer forested landscape.  The shallow soils and steep slopes usually prevent tree establishment, but small forested patches occur in the larger balds.  The balds and bluffs found immediately along the coastline and on ocean islands are distinguished as a different system.
1	CONUS	320	320	02.C.1.D022M050E320	7603	North Pacific Hypermaritime Shrub and Herbaceous Headland	These are the non-forested coastal headlands found along the Pacific Ocean from central Oregon north to British Columbia.  They occur both on headlands on the coast, as well as on many of the small to large off-shore islands.  The winds and salt spray either prevent or limit tree invasion into these grasslands or shrublands (which were also historically kept open by native American burning).  The include: dense shrub thickets of evergreen huckleberry, salal or salmonberry; tall grassland and forblands with Pacific reedgrass, angelica, coastal wormwood, or brakenfern; and low grasslands with red fescue and seapink.
1	CONUS	321	321	02.C.1.D022M050E321	5505	Willamette Valley Upland Prairie and Savanna	This grassland system is known only to the Puget Trough and Willamette Valley area. They are rare, dry, upland prairies and savannas found in the valleys and foothills of western Washington and Oregon.  Dominated by native bunchgrasses and diverse wildflowers, often with a few open and scattered trees of Oregon white oak, Douglas-fir or Ponderosa pine.  In Washington & British Columbia prairies can be found on glacial outwash areas, while in Oregon they are on deep soils and were maintained by native Indian burning.  Without regular burning, more and more trees would come in and shade out the prairie sun-loving wildflowers.  Much of these prairies have been coverted to agriculture or developed for housing.
1	CONUS	322	322	02.C.1.D022M168E322	7201	Mediterranean California Subalpine Meadow	This meadow occurs in mountains in Califorina, western Nevada and Oregon.  Tree establishment is limited by harsh environmental conditions such as excessively wet then dry soils, often with high snow deposition, then windswept dry conditions. Common plants include tundra aster, shorthair reedgrass, Mt. Hood pussy-paws, shorthair sedge, frosted wild buckwheat, and narrow false oats. Burrowing mammals are often present and increase the number of plants on site.
1	CONUS	323	323	02.C.1.D022M168E323	7205	Rocky Mountain Subalpine-Montane Mesic Meadow	High elevation meadows are found throughout the Rocky Mountains, often in a mosaic with conifer forests of spruce and fir just below the treeless alpine zone.  Sometimes they are found at middle and lower elevations of the mountains, but are mostly found on gentle to moderate slopes.  These meadows are often moist, but are only wet in the spring when snow is melting.  In the late summer they dry out, and are often good habitat for burrowing mammals such as ground squirrels or pocket gophers. Meadows such as these are very diverse in plant speices, with a mix of herbs and grasses; often they appear as lush fields of wildflowers.  Some of the common plants include fleabane, bluebells, beardtongue, bellflowers, lupines, goldenrod, licorice-root, western meadowrue, Sitka valerian, western coneflower, arrowleaf balsamroot, hairgrass, prairie junegrass, and perennial brome.
1	CONUS	324	324	02.C.1.D023M051E324	7302	Central Mixedgrass Prairie	The central mixedgrass prairie once covered vast areas from southern South Dakota to northern Texas.  It is still common in areas not converted to agriculture.  This prairie contains both shortgrass and tallgrass prairie species, which combine to form the mixedgrass prairie.  Western wheatgrass and little bluestem are widespread in this prairie.  Other common grasses include sideoats grama, little bluestem, big bluestem, needle-and-thread, prairie dropseed, and blue grama. Numerous forb and sedge species can also occur within the mixedgrass prairie.  Some dominant forb species include perennial ragweed, black-samson, and rush skeleton-plant. Oak species such as bur oak can occur in areas protected from fire due to topographic position.  Grazing and fire are important to maintaining the character of this prairie.  Fire, especially, prevents trees and shrubs from dominating the grasses.
1	CONUS	325	325	02.C.1.D023M051E325	7306	Northwestern Great Plains Mixedgrass Prairie	The northern mixedgrass system extends from northern Nebraska into southern Canada and westward through the Dakotas to the Rocky Mountain Front in Montana. The growing season and rainfall are intermediate to drier units to the southwest and mesic tallgrass regions to the east.  Grasses typically comprising the greatest canopy cover include western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, and fescue.  Fire and grazing constitute the primary dynamics affecting this system. Drought can also impact this system, in general favoring the shortgrass component at the expense of the mid-grasses. With intensive grazing, cool-season exotics such as Kentucky bluegrass and brome can increase in dominance. Shrub species such as can also increase in dominance with fire suppression. This system is one of the most disturbed grassland systems in Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and Canada.  Historically, this system covered approximately 38 million ha in Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and Canada.  Now it covers approximately 270,000 square km in this region.
1	CONUS	326	326	02.C.1.D023M051E326	7308	Western Great Plains Foothill and Piedmont Grassland	This mixed grassland occurs on foothill and mesa slopes along a relatively narrow elevational band near the base of the southern Rocky Mountain Front and extends east on to the plains in higher elevation piedmont areas from northeastern New Mexico to southeastern Wyoming. This area receives more abundant precipitation than the surrounding shortgrass prairie and can support mid and tall grasslands.  Common plants include a mixture of grasses such as big bluestem, little bluestem, mountain muhly, green needlegrass, western wheatgrass, needle-and-thread, New Mexico needlegrass,  blue grama (degraded sites), or bluebunch wheatgrass (northern sites).  This grassland is maintained by frequent fire. Without fire shrubs may invade and convert to shrubland.
1	CONUS	327	327	02.C.1.D023M051E327	7311	Western Great Plains Tallgrass Prairie	Tallgrass prairies can be found in patches throught the western Great Plains.  They are similar to the characteristic tallgrass prairies of the eastern Great Plains, but are usually found as small patches in mixedgreass prairies, often on terraces above floodplains or in areas with deep, loamy soils.  Similar to the prairies to the east, this system is dominated by big bluestem.  The primary dynamics for this system include fire, climate and grazing. Fire suppression in these areas has allowed for the invasion of woody species . Grazing also has contributed to these changes and likewise led to a decrease of this system as overgrazing favors shortgrass and mixedgrass systems. Conversion to agriculture likewise has probably decreased the range of this system. Thus, this system likely only occurs in small patches and in scattered locations throughout its range. Large-patch occurrences are mostly isolated to slopes and swales of rolling uplands where either grazing or cultivation are more problematic.
1	CONUS	328	328	02.C.1.D023M052E328	7309	Western Great Plains Sand Prairie	The sand prairies constitute a very unique system within the western Great Plainsand are often considered part of the tallgrass or mixedgrass regions in the western Great Plains. The largest expanse of sand prairies (approximately 5 million ha) can be found in the Sandhills of Nebraska and South Dakota. The unifying and controlling feature for this system is that coarse-textured soils predominate and the dominant grasses are well-adapted to this condition. Another important feature is their susceptibility to wind erosion. Grasses dominate the sand prairies, although relative dominance can change due to impacts of wind disturbance. Sand bluestem and prairie sandreed are the most common species. The primary use of this system has been grazing. Although greater than 90% of the Sandhills region is privately owned, the known fragility of the soils and the cautions used by ranchers to avoid poor grazing practices have allowed for fewer significant changes in the vegetation of the Sandhills and other sand prairies compared to other grassland systems. Fire also can influence this system.
1	CONUS	329	329	02.C.1.D023M052E329	5301	Western Great Plains Sandhill Steppe	This system is found mostly in south-central areas of the Western Great Plains Division ranging from southwestern Wyoming and southwestern Nebraska up into the Nebraska Sandhill region, south to central Texas. The climate is semi-arid to arid for much of the region in which this system occurs. This system is found on somewhat excessively to excessively well-drained, deep sandy soils that are often associated with dune systems and ancient floodplains. Typically, this system is characterized by a sparse to moderately dense woody layer dominated by sand sagebrush.   Associated  species can vary with geography, amount and season of precipitation, disturbance, and soil texture. Edaphic and climatic factors are the most important dynamic processes for this type, with drought and extreme winds impacting this system significantly in some areas.  Fire and grazing constitute the most important disturbances affecting this system.
1	CONUS	330	330	02.C.1.D023M053E330	5810	Western Great Plains Mesquite Woodland and Shrubland	This system is found primarily in the southern portion of the Western Great Plains Division, primarily in Texas, Oklahoma and eastern New Mexico. It is dominated by honey mesquite with shortgrass species such as blue grama or buffalograss typically present. Historically this system probably occurred as a natural component on more fertile soils and along drainages, but it has expanded its range into prairie uplands in recent decades.  Historically, fire controlled this system and limited the development of woody cover. Likewise, edaphic conditions and topographic factors limited this system to deep alluvial soils in relatively low topographic positions along broad valley floors.
1	CONUS	331	331	02.C.1.D023M053E331	7310	Western Great Plains Shortgrass Prairie	This system is found primarily in the western half of the Western Great Plains Division ranges from the Nebraska Panhandle south into Texas and New Mexico. It is the most common system in this range. This system occurs primarily on flat to rolling uplands with loamy soils and is characterized by blue grama.  Climate, fire and grazing influence this system.  The short grasses that dominate this system are extremely drought- and grazing-tolerant. In contrast to other prairie systems, fire is less important. However, historically, fires that did occur were often very expansive. Currently, fire suppression and more extensive grazing in the region have likely decreased the fire frequency even more. A large part of the range for this system has been converted to agriculture. Other areas have been impacted by the unsuccessful attempts to develop dryland cultivation during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. This system in combination with the associated wetland systems represents one of the richest areas for mammals and birds. Endemic bird species to the shortgrass system may constitute one of the fastest declining bird populations.
1	CONUS	332	332	02.C.1.D023M054E332	7313	Arkansas Valley Prairie and Woodland	This system of prairies and associated woodlands is found in the Arkansas River Valley region of Arkansas and adjacent Oklahoma. This region is distinctly bounded by the Boston Mountains to the north and the Ouachita Mountains to the south, although it has been considered part of the Ouachita Ecoregion (TNC Ecoregion 39). The valley is characterized by broad, level to gently rolling uplands derived from shales and is much less rugged and more heavily impacted by Arkansas River erosional processes than the adjacent mountainous regions. In addition, the valley receives annual precipitation total of 2-6 inches less than the surrounding regions due to a rainshadow produced by a combination of prevailing western winds and mountain orographic effects. The shale-derived soils associated with the prairies are thin and droughty. The combined effect of droughty soils, reduced precipitation, and prevailing level topography create conditions highly conducive to the ignition and spread of fires. Stands are typically dominated by big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, switchgrass, and little bluestem. Some extant examples of this system remain, but most are small and isolated. They were common on the western edge of the region bordering or possibly included in the Crosstimbers (TNC Ecoregion 32) where precipitation and agriculture conversion were lowest.
1	CONUS	333	333	02.C.1.D023M054E333	7315	Central Tallgrass Prairie	The central tallgrass prairie was once extremely abundant in the Midwestern US from eastern Nebraska and Kansas to northwestern Indiana.  It is now much less common due to conversion to agricultural uses.  These prairies are found on deep, rich soils, often more than 1 meter deep.  Grasses between 1 and 2 meters, sometimes up to 3 meters tall in the richest locations typify this system.  Big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, and switchgrass are the most common.  Other shorter grasses that were often present or even characteristic in small patches such as dry slopes.  Many wildflowers can be found in these prairies, as well, making them one of the most diverse grasslands.  Fire was necessary to prevent shrubs and trees from invading the prairie.  Most sites burned every 2-5 years.  However, conversion to agriculture has been the prime disturbance since European settlement. The rich soils and long growing season make this an ideal location for farming row crops, and as a result very few examples of this system remain.
1	CONUS	334	334	02.C.1.D023M054E334	5506	North-Central Interior Oak Savanna	Northern oak savannas are found primarily in the northern glaciated regions of the Midwest with the largest concentration in the prairie-forest border ecoregion. It is typically found on rolling outwash plains, hills and ridges. Soils are typically moderately well- to well-drained deep loams. This system is typified by scattered trees over a continual tallgrass prairie. Bur oak is the most common tree species and can range from 10-60% cover. The understory is dominated by tallgrass prairie species such as big bluestem and little bluestem. Historically, frequent fires maintained this savanna system within its range and would have restricted tree canopies to 10-30%. Fire suppression in the region has allowed trees to establish more dense canopies. Periodic, strong wind disturbances and browsing also impact this system. Much of this system has also been converted to agriculture, and thus its range has decreased considerably.
1	CONUS	335	335	02.C.1.D023M054E335	7312	North-Central Interior Sand and Gravel Tallgrass Prairie	This system is found in the northern Midwest, particularly in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan. It is often found on glacial features such as kames, eskers, moraines, lakeplains (excluding the Great Lakes lakeplain), sandplains, and along eolian dunes. In contrast to the deeper, richer soils supporting other tallgrass systems in the region, the underlying soils in this system tend to be more shallow, sandy, rocky, and/or gravelly outwash soils. Grassland species such as little bluestem, big bluestem, and gramas characterize this system and vary  from sparse to moderately dense. Woody species more tolerant of droughty conditions such as Jack pine and oaks may be found in some examples. Fire and drought are the major dynamics influencing this system. If fire and periodic drought are not present, woody species begin to invade this system. Wind can also play a role, especially on examples found on sandplains and/or eolian dunes.
1	CONUS	336	336	02.C.1.D023M054E336	5507	North-Central Oak Barrens	"Northern oak barrens occur on well-drained, coarse-textured sandy soils derived from glacial outwash, end moraine formations, or lakeplain dune systems in the north-central U.S. and adjacent Canada, and extends into the northeast in a limited area of western New York. The sandy soils have low fertility, organic matter, and moisture-retention capacity. This oak barrens system is a scrubby, open-treed system dominated by graminoids and shrubs. The canopy layer is dominated by black oak, with some bur oak and white oak. Canopy structure varies from a dominant herbaceous ground layer with sparse, scattered ""savanna"" canopy (5-30%), through oak-dominated scrub, to a more closed woodland canopy (30-80%). Fire was an important factor in maintaining this community. Oak wilt and droughts also reduce tree cover."
1	CONUS	337	337	02.C.1.D023M054E337	7314	Northern Tallgrass Prairie	"Northern tallgrass system ranges along the Red River basin in Minnesota and the Dakotas to Lake Manitoba in Canada. It constitutes the northernmost extension of the ""true"" prairies. Similar to Central Tallgrass Prairie, this system is dominated by tallgrass species such as big bluestem, yellow indiangrass, and switchgrass. However, the soils in this region are not as rich nor deep, and thus this system does not have as much species diversity as grasslands to the south. This system is often found on well-drained, drier soils and can grade into Eastern Great Plains Tallgrass Aspen Parkland to the north and east. Grazing and fire influenced this system historically. Much of this system has been converted to agriculture with very few unaltered and highly fragmented examples remaining."
1	CONUS	338	338	02.C.1.D023M054E338	7317	Southeastern Great Plains Tallgrass Prairie	This system is found primarily within the Flint Hills and Osage Plains of Kansas and Oklahoma. Small patches can be found in the Ozarks of Missouri and the Arbuckle Mountains of Oklahoma. It is distinguished from Central Tallgrass Prairie System by having more species with southwestern geographic affinities and the presence of a thin soil layer over limestone beds ranging to more acidic substrates. Because of the presence of the rocky substrate close to the surface and the rolling topography, this area is relatively unsuitable for agriculture. The Flint Hills contain one of the largest remaining, relatively intact pieces of tallgrass prairie. The vegetation in this system is typified by a dense cover of tallgrass species with moderate to high density of forb species. Shrub and tree species are relatively infrequent. Fire and grazing constitute the major dynamic processes for this region. Although many of the native common plant species still occur, grazing does impact this region. Poor grazing practices can lead to soil erosion and invasion by cool-season grasses.
1	CONUS	339	339	02.C.1.D023M054E339	7316	Southern Blackland Tallgrass Prairie	This system is found primarily in the Blackland Prairie region of Texas but can range into southern Oklahoma. It is typified by the presence of dark, basic soils over calcareous parent material interspersed with patches of acidic, sandy loams. Microtopography such as gilgai and mima mounds can occur and are important microhabitats that lead to a high degree of plant diversity in this system. Little bluestem) and yellow Indiangrass are the most frequent species.  Fire and grazing constitute the major natural dynamics influencing this system. Infrequent, but intense, fires prevent woody species from establishing. Fire suppression and over grazing have allowed woody species to invade, and heavy grazing has allowed species such as buffalograss and Texas grama to invade.
1	CONUS	340	340	02.C.1.D023M054E340	7505	Texas-Louisiana Coastal Prairie	This system encompasses non-saline tallgrass prairie vegetation ranging along the coast of Louisiana and Texas. This vegetation is found on Vertisols and Alfisols which developed over Pleistocene terraces flanking the Gulf Coast. It is often characterized by a ridge-and-swale or mound-and-intermound microtopography and encompasses both upland and wetland plant communities. Upland dominants include little bluestem, brownseed crowngrass, yellow Indiangrass, and big bluestem. Wetland dominants in undisturbed occurrences include switchgrass and eastern gammagrass; disturbed occurrences may be dominated by bushy broom-sedge. Some estimates state that 99% of coastal prairie has been lost through conversion to other uses and environmental degradation due to the interruption of important ecological processes, such as fire, needed to maintain this system. In the absence of regular fire, this system will be invaded by woody shrubs and trees.

It occurs at lower elevations over much of its range, but occasionally can be found at up to 4000 feet in West Virginia. The substrate rock is acidic, often granitic, including traprock in New England. The tree canopy is patchy, mostly open woodland and often contains non-wooded openings. Pitch pine and/or Virginia pine are diagnostic and often are mixed with dry-site oaks (including black oak and scarlet oak) and sprouts of American chestnut. Some areas have a fairly well-developed heath shrub layer, others a grassy layer. Conditions are dry and nutrient-poor, and at many, if not most, sites, a history of fire is evident.

Vegetation consists either of dense shrub-dominated areas (heath balds) or dense herbaceous cover dominated by grasses or sedges (grassy balds). The combination of high-elevation, non-wetland sites and dense herbaceous or shrub vegetation without appreciable rock outcrop conceptually distinguishes this system from all others in the southern Appalachians. However, the widespread areas of degraded spruce-fir with grass and shrub cover and the invasion of grassy balds by trees blur the distinction somewhat.

1	CONUS	345	345	02.C.1.D024M124E345	5511	Central Appalachian Alkaline Glade and Woodland	Open woodlands with a grassy understory, on thin soils over calcareous rock, occur at low to moderate elevations from the Central Appalachians down into the Ridge and Valley.  Mostly open and park-like, in some cases, they grade into closed-canopy forests. Red-cedar is a common tree, increasing in cover in in the absence of fire, and chinquapin oak is diagnostic and  indicative of the limestone substrate.  Prairie grasses (big bluestem, Indian grass, little bluestem, grama) are the dominant herbs; forb richness is often high. Characteristic forbs include whorled milkweed, wild bergamot, lyreleaf sage, aromatic aster, and false boneset.  Fire is sometimes an important means of natural disturbance, but the open vegetation structure may also be maintained by drought and landslides.
1	CONUS	346	346	02.C.1.D024M124E346	5512	Central Interior Highlands Calcareous Glade and Barrens	This mixed grassland and woodland is found primarily in the Ozarks, Ouachitas, and east into Tennessee and Kentucky with scattered occurrences in northern Missouri.  It occurs along moderate to steep slopes and steep valleys on primarily south- to west-facing slopes. Limestone and/or dolomite bedrock typify these glades with shallow soils interspersed with rocks. These soils often dry out during the summer and autumn, and then become wet during the winter and spring. Little bluestem is characteristic and commonly associated with big bluestem, sideoats grama, and calcium-loving plant species.  Stunted woodlands primarily dominated by chinquapin oak interspersed with eastern red-cedar occur on variable-depth-to-bedrock soils. Fire is the primary natural dynamic, and prescribed fires help manage these by restricting woody growth and maintaining the more open glade structure.
1	CONUS	347	347	02.C.1.D024M124E347	4325	Central Interior Highlands Dry Acidic Glade and Barrens	These mixed grasslands and woodlands are primarily found in the Ozarks and Ouachitas and east into Kentucky, southern Illinois, and southern Indiana with small, scattered occurrences in northern Missouri.  They occur on flatrock outcrops and along moderate to steep slopes or valley walls of rivers. They are found on chert, igneous, and/or sandstone bedrock with dry, shallow soils interspersed with rock and boulders. These soils are typically dry during the summer and autumn but wet during the spring and winter. Grasses such as little bluestem and yellow Indiangrass typify this system with stunted oak species (post oak, blackjack oak) and shrub species such as blueberry occurring where enough soil accumulates. Eastern red-cedar can be present and often increases in the absence of fire.  These sites are influenced by drought and infrequent to occasional fires. Prescribed fires help manage this vegetation by maintaining an open glade structure.

Almost all of North America's alvars occur within the Great Lakes basin, primarily in an arc along the Niagaran Escarpment from northern Lake Michigan across northern Lake Huron and eastern Ontario and northwestern New York state. These communities are characterized by distinctive flora and fauna with less than 60% tree cover.  Alvars tend to flood each spring, then experience moderate to severe drought in summer months.  They include open pavement, grassland, and shrublands/woodlands.  Common species include eastern white cedar, white spruce, juniper, little bluestem, and poverty oat-grass.

These glades occur in broad valley bottoms or rolling basins where soils are shallow over flat-lying limestone strata.  The flat terrain and locally xeric soils may have been especially susceptible to periodic fires that helped maintain the prairie-like openings and savanna-like woodlands.  Today, much of the system is currently somewhat more closed and brushy, suggesting fire suppression.

Bedrock includes a variety of igneous and metamorphic rock types, including shale. Examples support open vegetation of patchy, mixed physiognomy with a significant woody component. Shallow soils which impede tree growth, help distinguish this system from forest systems of the southern Piedmont. This system is structurally intermediate between non-forested rock outcrop systems and forest systems.

The terrain is flat to gently sloping.  Shanks (1958) also specifically refers to barrens on ""cherty residuum, elsewhere characterized by Planosols with impeded drainage.""  Some proposed factors which have functioned to maintain their openness include the droughty, gravelly soils and resulting stresses to vegetation, as well as fire.

Examples occur on flat, low-lying terrain over moderately to poorly drained soils with sandy surfaces overlying organic hardpans or clayey subsoil (FNAI 1990). This type was historically expansive in several regions of Florida (Harper 1927). Early surveyors noted large expanses of this system on the plains near the Kissimmee River, north from Lake Okeechobee, and in the area west of Lake Okeechobee (Fisheating Creek) (Huffman and Judd 1998). The original extent has been heavily reduced by clearing for agriculture and conversion for forage production. Intact examples have been further altered by fire suppression which changes the proportion of grasses and shrubs and may further alter species composition. Frequent fires were an important natural process in this system, with an estimated frequency of 1-4 years (FNAI 1990).
1	CONUS	363	363	02.C.1.D102M162E363	5214	Florida Peninsula Inland Scrub	"This system appears in many forms, but generally consists of xeromorphic shrub vegetation (mostly oak species) with or without an emergent overstory of sand pine (sand pine). Ground cover is always sparse, and bare soil patches are typically evident. It is found on a sequence of sand ridges and ancient dune fields which are oriented essentially north-south in the Florida Peninsula. This system has long been noted for its unique and interesting vegetation by authors such as Vignoles (1823), Harper (1914), Mulvania (1931), Kurz (1942), and Laessle (1958, 1968). More recent treatments by Myers (1990) and Menges (1999) have provided the most comprehensive summaries of scrub available. According to Harper (1927), ""the nearly pure white sand of the ground surface, when viewed from a short distance, gives the impression of a thin rift of wind-driven snow. The vegetation is mostly dwarfed, gnarled and crooked, and presents a tangled, scraggly aspect."" The appearance, floristics, and boundary of Florida scrub contrast dramatically with the ""high pine"" or sandhill vegetation which is often adjacent (Laessle 1968)."
1	CONUS	364	364	02.C.1.D102M308E364	5513	West Gulf Coastal Plain Catahoula Barrens	This system is confined to the Catahoula geologic formation of eastern Texas and western Louisiana. It includes a vegetational mosaic ranging from herbaceous-dominated areas on shallow soil and exposed sandstone to deeper soils with open woodland vegetation. Woodlands include a post oak-dominated overstory grading into longleaf pine-dominated areas. Seasonal droughtiness, shallow soils, aluminum toxicity, and periodic fires are important factors that influence the composition and structure of this system.
1	CONUS	365	365	02.C.1.D102M308E365	5514	West Gulf Coastal Plain Nepheline Syenite Glade	"This glade system is present only in Saline and Pulaski counties, Arkansas, on distinctive, massive outcrops of igneous substrate (""nepheline syenite""). Zonal vegetation communities are present around the outcrops. Interior herbaceous-dominated zones can be mesic to wet as springs and small ephemeral streams flow across the rock outcrops and water pools in flat areas. Deeper, more heavily wooded vegetation develops along the flat or slightly sloping outcrop edges."
1	CONUS	366	366	02.C.1.D102M309E366	9901	East Gulf Coastal Plain Jackson Plain Dry Flatwoods - Open Understory Modifier	"This system represents predominately dry flatwoods of limited areas of the most inland portions of the East Gulf Coastal Plain in western Kentucky.  This broad region is referred to as the Jackson Purchase.  These flatwoods have long been recognized as a distinctive subdivision within this region (Davis 1923, Bryant and Martin 1988).  They tend to be confined to an area near the eastern flank of the region where loess deposits thin out and gravelly or sandy soils predominate.  Examples are typified by ridge-and-swale topography.  The ridges are somewhat coarser-textured soils and retain less moisture than do the swales, although both occur in a tight local mosaic.  The soils appear to have well-developed subsurface hardpans.  The impermeability of these hardpans contributes to shallowly perched water tables during portions of the year when precipitation is greatest and evapotranspiration is lowest (not due to overbank flooding).  Thus, soil moisture fluctuates widely throughout the growing season, from saturated to very dry, a condition sometimes referred to as xerohydric (Evans 1991).  Fire was an important natural process in this system, and well-burned examples tend to be relatively open-canopied with well-developed herbaceous layers (M. Evans pers. Comm.).

Variation:  Open Understory - Areas dominated by herbaceous or widely scattered shrubs.  Frequent fire or management are usually needed to maintain the open aspect.

Other Variation(s):  Scrub/Shrub Understory."
1	CONUS	367	367	02.C.1.D102M309E367	7319	West Gulf Coastal Plain Northern Calcareous Prairie	This is one of two described calcareous prairie ecological systems which occur within the pine-dominated portions of the Coastal Plain west of the Mississippi River. This type is the more northerly ranging of the two [compare against ~West Gulf Coastal Plain Southern Calcareous Prairie (CES203.379)$$]. This system includes natural grassland vegetation and associated wooded vegetation in a relatively small natural region of the Upper West Gulf Coastal Plain of Arkansas and adjacent Oklahoma. Although other calcareous prairies are found west of the Mississippi River, this system represents some of the largest known and highest quality remaining examples. Plant communities in this system occur over relatively deep soils (as well as shallow soils over chalk and limestone) with circumneutral surface soil pH, which is unusual given the predominance of acidic, generally forested soils in the region. In most cases individual prairie openings are small and isolated from one another, but were formerly more extensive prior to European settlement, forming a mosaic of grassland and woodlands under frequent fire regimes. The flora has much in common with other prairie systems of the East Gulf Coastal Plains as well as classic Midwestern prairies.
1	CONUS	368	368	02.C.1.D102M309E368	7320	West Gulf Coastal Plain Southern Calcareous Prairie	This is one of two described calcareous prairie ecological systems which occur within the pine-dominated portions of the Coastal Plain west of the Mississippi River. This type is the more southerly ranging of the two [compare against ~West Gulf Coastal Plain Northern Calcareous Prairie (CES203.377)$$]. Examples include natural grassland vegetation and adjacent wooded vegetation in a relatively small natural region of Louisiana and Texas. Although most examples are typically upland, some include small stream bottoms or riparian areas that bisect the prairies. This system is found primarily within the historical range of longleaf pine, or TNC Ecoregion 41, but it extends somewhat beyond this area to the north. In addition, examples occurring west to the eastern edge of the Post Oak Savanna region of eastern Texas are also included here. Plant communities in this system occur over relatively deep soils with circumneutral surface soil pH. These conditions are unusual in the local landscape which is predominantly one of acidic, generally forested soils. In most cases individual prairie openings are small and isolated from one another. Although they were formerly more extensive prior to European settlement, they apparently were much smaller than examples of ~West Gulf Coastal Plain Northern Calcareous Prairie (CES203.377)$$.
1	CONUS	369	369	02.C.2.D025M127E369	5107	Acadian-Appalachian Subalpine Woodland and Heath-Krummholz	"These expanses of stunted conifers occur near and slightly above montane treeline in northeastern North America.  On higher mountains, it forms a zone between montane spruce-fir forest and alpine tundra; on mountains that do not reach above treeline, it may cover the ridgelines and summits. In the Appalachians it occurs mostly above 3000â elevation but can be at much lower elevations near the north Atlantic coast.  Spruce and fir become progressively stunted as exposure increases, and may form nearly impenetrable ""krummholz"" thickets above treeline. The vegetation structure ranges from scattered trees to shrub cover to sparsely vegetated dwarf-shrubs and herbs, interspersed with patches of open rock.  Deciduous shrubs such as nannyberry provide cover in somewhat protected areas; dwarf heaths including Labrador teac, sheep laurel, bilberry, and lowbush blueberry, are more typical in open areas. Crowberry is a diagnostic and sometimes dominant dwarf-shrub."
1	CONUS	370	370	02.C.3.D026M057E370	9401	Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain Interdunal Wetland	This system of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain encompasses the wettest dune swales and basins on barrier islands and coastal areas, supporting pond or marsh-like vegetation.  Most examples are permanently or semipermanently flooded with freshwater, but are affected by salt spray or overwash during periodic storm events.
1	CONUS	371	371	02.C.3.D026M057E371	7503	Atlantic Coastal Plain Southern Dune and Maritime Grassland	"This system consists primarily of grasslands and related shrublands of Atlantic Coastal Plain barrier islands and related near-coastal areas from North Carolina southward to northern Florida. For the remainder of the Florida Coast, south of Cape Canaveral to the sandy portions of the Florida Keys, this system occurs in a more attenuated fashion. A distinct system could be recognized, but this does not seem necessary. Upland plant communities and non-flooded wetlands (including ""maritime wet grasslands"") are included in this system as embedded or ""inclusional"" shrublands. The environment of this system is highly dynamic. Reworking of sand by storms or by slower eolian processes may completely change the local environment in a short time, and portions of the system may occupy sites fairly early in the process of primary succession. The combined effects of chronic and extreme salt spray and ocean overwash prevent or dramatically inhibit woody plant growth."
1	CONUS	372	372	02.C.3.D026M057E372	7508	Central and Upper Texas Coast Dune and Coastal Grassland	This system consists of wetland and upland herbaceous and shrubland vegetation of barrier islands and near-coastal areas in the northern Gulf of Mexico along the upper Texas coast, at least to Galveston Bay. Plant communities of primary and secondary dunes, interdunal swales and adjacent mainland are included. Salt spray, saltwater overwash, and sand movement are important ecological forces.
1	CONUS	373	373	02.C.3.D026M057E373	7506	East Gulf Coastal Plain Dune and Coastal Grassland	This system includes vegetation of coastal dunes along the northern Gulf of Mexico, including the northwestern panhandle of Florida, southern Alabama, and southeastern Mississippi. The vegetation consists largely of herbaceous and embedded shrublands on barrier islands and other near-coastal areas where salt spray, saltwater overwash, and sand movement are important ecological forces. This vegetation differs from that of other regions of the Gulf, and this region forms a natural unit with similar climate and substrate (Johnson 1997). There are a number of diagnostic and endemic plant species which characterize this system, including florida rosemary, woody-goldenrod, gulf bluestem, sand squares, and gulf rockrose (Johnson and Barbour 1990).
1	CONUS	374	374	02.C.3.D026M057E374	3116	Great Lakes Dune	These sand dunes are found along the shores of the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain.  Plant cover varies from open, active dunes to areas dominated by grasses, shrubs, and trees, depending on the degree of sand deposition, sand erosion, and distance from the lake.  Dune grasses, particularly American beachgrass, little bluestem, and prairie sandreed, dominate the most active areas. More stable portions may have low shrubs including beach heather, juniper, and sand cherry.  Back dunes may grade into wooded cover of pines and other sandy soil trees.  Some of the best examples of this system include Grand Sable Dune and Sleeping Bear Dunes in Michigan and Indiana Dunes in Indiana.
1	CONUS	375	375	02.C.3.D026M057E375	7507	Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain Dune and Swale	This system consists of vegetation of sandy barrier islands and other exposed coastal areas, ranging from northern North Carolina to southern Maine (where extensive sandy coastlines are replaced by rocky coasts). A range of plant communities may be present, but the most classic component is a dune grassland, with American beachgrass diagnostic. Shrublands may occur in limited areas. In between some dunes, and intimately connected with them,  narrow wetland grassy swales may develop.  Small patches of natural woodland, typically featuring pitch pine, may also be present in limited areas, especially in the northern part of the range. The dominant ecological processes are those associated with the maritime environment, including frequent salt spray, wind, saltwater overwash, and sand movement.
1	CONUS	376	376	02.C.3.D026M057E376	5807	Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain Heathland and Grassland	Sandplain grasslands and heathlands of the southern New England and New York coast are areas of grass-, sedge-, and shrub-dominated vegetation maintained by maritime conditions and periodic fire or other disturbance. Developing on acidic, nutrient-poor, and very well-drained soils, they may occur as heathlands, grasslands, or support a patchwork of grass and shrub vegetation. Characteristic species include huckleberry, bearberry, broom crowberry, Nantucket shadbush, golden heather, blueberry, little bluestem, and Pennsylvania sedge. They are important habitat for several bird and other animal species including the short-eared owl and regal fritillary, and (along with brushy plains and woodlands) provided habitat for the extinct heath hen.
1	CONUS	377	377	02.C.3.D026M057E377	7510	South Texas Dune and Coastal Grassland	This system includes non-tidal maritime grasslands occurring on barrier islands and mainland areas near the coast of southern Texas. This includes grasslands of primary and secondary dunes, interdune swales, barrier flats, and the mainland. Some examples of this system naturally occurred as an open matrix of midgrass species within native mesquite - acacia shrublands dominated by honey mesquite, sweet acacia, and blackbrush acacia but have become shrub-dominated due to the lack of fire. In many areas this system has been virtually eliminated due to conversion to tame pasture, cropland, or due to lack of burning.
1	CONUS	378	378	02.C.3.D026M057E378	7324	South Texas Sand Sheet Grassland	This system occurs on the ridge-and-swale topography within 100 km of the Texas coast on the Holocene-aged eolian sand deposits of the South Texas Sand Sheet (primarily Kenedy and Brooks counties and extending into adjacent Jim Hogg, Hidalgo, and Willacy counties). While the vegetation of the ridges and swales is somewhat distinct, they are not separated here. In general, ridges are dominated by seaside bluestem and a mixture of forbs, and swales are dominated by gulfdune crowngrass, big bluestem, hair-awn muhly, and yellow Indiangrass. Brownseed crowngrass may be important in both environments. In addition to the dominants, common herbaceous components include lovegrass spp., round copperleaf, tall silverbush, Texas sensitive-pea, Texas tread-softly, sandhill croton, slimspike prairie-clover, plains snake-cotton, hoary milkpea, McKelvey's beeblossom, Georgia frostweed, shrubby beebalm, pointed phlox, American snoutbean, queen's delight, and Rio Grande greenthread. These grasslands occur intermixed with woodlands dominated by plateau live oak and/or honey mesquite.
1	CONUS	379	379	02.C.3.D026M057E379	7504	Southwest Florida Dune and Coastal Grassland	This system occurs in the Gulf of Mexico along the southwestern coast of Florida. Components of this system include herbaceous vegetation on dunes and related vegetation just inland of the dunes, often on recently deposited sands. These are generally upland plant communities and less commonly non-flooded dune swale wetlands. Although vegetation is mostly herbaceous, there are typically scattered shrubs of various heights present. Examples of this system occupy one of four distinctive coastal regions in Florida. Although a given community component of this system may overlap in species composition with those of other Florida coastal regions, there are important and sometimes considerable differences based on plant species composition, vegetation structure, and physical site characteristics (Johnson and Muller 1993a). The dune vegetation, like that of other Florida regions, includes sea-oats, coastal panicgrass, and dune marsh-elder. Beachberry, coastal beach sandmat, and sea-grape help distinguish this system from those to the north. However, while all other dune communities in Florida have frequently occurring distinctive species which help distinguish them, such species are lacking in this system. However, more inland coastal grassland components of this system sometimes include tropical bluestem and hairy grama, among other species not found in coastal grasslands elsewhere in Florida (Johnson and Muller 1993a).
1	CONUS	380	380	02.C.3.D027M058E380	3211	North Pacific Coastal Cliff and Bluff	This ecological system includes unvegetated or sparsely vegetated rock cliffs and very steep bluffs of glacial deposits along the Pacific Ocean and eroding slopes in southwestern British Columbia south into central Oregon. It is composed of barren and sparsely vegetated substrates, typically including exposed sediments, bedrock, and scree slopes. Exposure to waves, eroding and desiccating winds, slope failures and sheet erosion create gravelly to rocky substrates that are often unstable. There can be sparse cover of wildflowers, grasses, lichens and low shrubs.
1	CONUS	381	381	02.C.3.D027M058E381	3124	North Pacific Maritime Coastal Sand Dune and Strand	Coastal dunes include beach strand not the beach itself but sparsely or densely vegetated areas behind the beach, foredunes, sand spits, and active to stabile dunes and sandsheets derived from quartz or gypsum sands. They are found throughout the northern Pacific Coast, from south-central Alaska to the central Oregon coast to roughly Coos Bay.  A pattern of sometimes very open and sometimes very dense vegetation on dunes is driven by sand deposition and  erosion caused by wind and occasional wave overwash during storm tidal surges. Salt water inlets and tidal marshes may be nearby.  Plant life typically includes herbaceous, succulent, shrub, and tree species with varying degrees of tolerance for salt spray, wind and sand abrasion, and substrate stability.  Common species include sand ryegrass, red fescue, sea lyme grass, or various forbs.  Salal and evergreen blueberry are commonly seen shrub species. Some dunes may have patches of  young shore pine.
1	CONUS	382	382	02.C.3.D027M058E382	5218	Northern California Coastal Scrub	This dense chaparral is found along a narrow coastal strip in Northern California. It grows on  coastal bluffs, terraces, stabilized dunes, and hills below 500 m 1500 feet in elevation from southern Oregon south through central California. Characteristic species include coyotebrush,  yellow bush lupine,  blueblossom,  seaside woolly sunflower,  orange bush-monkeyflower,  poison-oak,  California blackberry,  thimbleberry,  salmonberry, California coffeeberry, oceanspray, salal,  cow-parsnip, and sword fern.  These areas have supported extensive stand-replacing wildfires. Without fire,  Grand fir and Douglas-fir can invade and become prominent.. Neighboring grasslands, part of the California Northern Coastal Grassland , will have shrubs begin to invade and with time, will convert into the chaparral, in the absence of fire and/or grazing.
1	CONUS	383	383	02.C.3.D027M059E383	3305	Mediterranean California Coastal Bluff	Oceanside cliffs, headlands and bluffs found along the rugged coastal parts of southern Oregon and California, south to Baja Norte, including off-shore islands.  Habitats are steep and sparsely vegetated, usually supporting grasses, wildflowers (often succulent), and occasionally small shrubs that can cope with salt spray and drought.
1	CONUS	384	384	02.C.3.D027M059E384	3123	Mediterranean California Northern Coastal Dune	These are open coastal dune systems, ranging from small sandy areas near beaches to more extensive dunes near larger rivers and bays.  They incude open sand dunes, stablized dunes with native grasses, forbs and shrubs, and rarely forests. This coastal system occurs in scattered locations on the coast from Point Conception, California, north to Coos Bay, Oregon. Coastal dunes include beaches, foredunes, sand spits, active or stable dunes made of quartz or gypsum sands.  They may also occur as extensive dune fields dominating large coastal bays. Dune vegetation typically includes herbaceous, succulent, and low-shrub species with varying degrees of tolerance for salt spray, wind and sand abrasion, and substrate stability. Coyote brush, silver burr ragweed, buckwheat, and native dune grasses and forbs are most important.  Introduced European beachgrass and yellow bush lupine in the north invade and change these systems.
1	CONUS	385	385	02.C.3.D027M059E385	3122	Mediterranean California Southern Coastal Dune	Coastal dunes include beaches, foredunes, sand spits, and active to stabilizing backdunes and sandsheets derived from quartz or gypsum sands. The mosaic of sparse to dense vegetation in dune systems is driven by sand deposition, erosion, and lateral movement.  Dune vegetation typically includes herbaceous, succulent, and low-shrub species with varying degrees of tolerance for salt spray, wind and sand abrasion, and stability of the sand.  Generally, this dune system includes fewer perennial grasses and more succulent plants than more northern dune systems. This system can be dominated by red sand-verbena, pink sand-verbena, beach saltbush, Menzies' jimmyweed, saltgrass, California croton, dune lupine, and sea-fig.
1	CONUS	386	386	02.C.3.D028M060E386	3106	Atlantic Coastal Plain Northern Sandy Beach	This system includes sparsely vegetated ocean beaches constituting the outermost zone of coastal vegetation ranging from northern North Carolina northward to the terminus of extensive sandy coastlines and the beginning of rocky coasts.  Examples generally extend seaward from foredunes but may include flats behind breached foredunes.  Although these habitats are situated just above the mean high tide limit, they are constantly impacted by waves and may be flooded by high spring tides and storm surges (Fleming et al. 2001).  Constant salt spray and rainwater maintain generally moist conditions.  Substrates consist of unconsolidated sand and shell sediments that are constantly shifted by winds and floods.  Dynamic disturbance regimes largely limit vegetation to pioneering, salt-tolerant, succulent annuals.  Cakile edentula ssp. edentula and Salsola caroliniana are usually most numerous and characteristic.  Other scattered associates include Sesuvium maritimum, Polygonum glaucum, Polygonum ramosissimum var. prolificum, Suaeda linearis and Suaeda maritima, and Atriplex pentandra.
1	CONUS	387	387	02.C.3.D028M060E387	3119	Atlantic Coastal Plain Sea Island Beach	This system represents beaches and overwash flats in the Sea Island region of South Carolina and Georgia. The entire region is distinctive on the Atlantic Coast, and wave energy is generally lower here than any other point along the Atlantic Coast (Tanner 1960). Huge quantities of fine-textured sediments are deposited by alluvial rivers in the region, many of which drain relatively large interior areas of the Piedmont, where clay is an abundant by-product of weathering and erosion. Thus, as opposed to other beaches of the Atlantic Coast, these beaches are characterized by the prevalence of fine-textured sediments. In addition, the extensive Continental Shelf coupled with low wave energy contribute to a paucity of shell components of the beach substrates.
1	CONUS	388	388	02.C.3.D028M060E388	3107	Atlantic Coastal Plain Southern Beach	This beach system is found along the Atlantic Coast of extreme southern Georgia ranging into eastern Florida to approximately Cape Canaveral.  Unlike Atlantic Coastal Plain Sea Island Beach (CES203.383) to the north, this system is subject to higher wave energy and a greater component of sand.  Vegetation of this area is distinct from that further south along the coast of Florida (Johnson and Muller 1993).
1	CONUS	389	389	02.C.3.D028M060E389	3118	Florida Panhandle Beach Vegetation	The panhandle beach system ranges from northwestern Florida (Ochlockonee River) to southeastern Mississippi. It includes the outermost zone of coastal vegetation extending seaward from foredunes. Within the northern Gulf of Mexico, the natural boundaries of this system are fairly distinct; the western boundary is mineralogical and the eastern is defined by a region of sunken, flooded coast line where beaches are absent. In addition, these beaches are distinguished by high cover of sea-oats and gulf bluestem, along with local endemic species of woody-goldenrod and nailwort (Barbour et al. 1987).
1	CONUS	390	390	02.C.3.D028M060E390	3114	Louisiana Beach	Louisiana beaches are predominantly found on remnant barrier islands associated with historic delta lobes of the Mississippi River. Since normal deltaic processes have been altered, the formation of new barrier islands has been halted and most Louisiana barrier islands are undergoing deterioration. Within the northern Gulf region these beaches are distinguished by dominance of saltmeadow cordgrass instead of sea-oats. Also characteristic are coastal sandbur and saltmarsh dropseed (Barbour et al. 1987).
1	CONUS	391	391	02.C.3.D028M060E391	3112	Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain Sandy Beach	This system includes sparsely vegetated sand beaches along the northeast coast from northern North Carolina northward to mid-coastal Maine (where extensive sandy coastlines give way to rocky coasts).   They generally extend seaward from the sand dunes but may include flats behind breached dunes. Although these habitats are situated just above the mean high tide limit, they are constantly impacted by waves and may be flooded by high spring tides and storm surges. Constant salt spray and rainwater maintain generally moist conditions. Substrates consist of unconsolidated sand and shell sediments that are constantly shifted by winds and floods. Dynamic disturbance regimes largely limit vegetation to pioneering, salt-tolerant, succulent annuals. Sea-rocket and Russian thistle are usually most numerous and characteristic, with other scattered maritime environment associates.  These beaches provide nesting habitat for piping plovers and other birds.
1	CONUS	392	392	02.C.3.D028M060E392	3125	Texas Coastal Bend Beach	This system includes sparsely vegetated ocean beaches constituting the outermost zone of coastal vegetation ranging from and including Matagorda Island south to include Padre Island in Texas. These beaches are located on accretionary barrier islands, and they are generally well-developed with a stable dune system behind them. Examples generally extend seaward from foredunes but may include flats behind breached foredunes. Although these habitats are situated just above the mean high tide limit, they are constantly impacted by wind and salt spray and may be flooded by storm surges. Characteristic dominants are xerophytes and include the perennials railroad-vine and beach morning-glory and the annual twisted sea-rocket.
1	CONUS	393	393	02.C.3.D028M060E393	3113	Upper Texas Coast Beach	This system includes sparsely vegetated ocean beaches of the upper Texas Coast. These beaches are generally eroding and narrow. It constitutes the outermost zone of coastal vegetation ranging from mainland shores of the Chenier Plain of Louisiana to the barrier islands and spits of central Texas north of Matagorda Island. Although these habitats are situated just above the mean high tide limit, they are constantly impacted by waves and may be flooded by storm surges. Dynamic disturbance regimes largely limit vegetation to pioneering, salt-tolerant, succulent annuals. These beaches are generally unstable and highly impacted by attempts to limit the natural erosional processes. Accumulation is limited by the lack of sediments entering the gulf because most rivers in this area enter bays with their sediments not reaching the gulf.
1	CONUS	395	395	02.C.4.D029M063E395	9505	Mediterranean California Serpentine Fen	This system includes unique assemblages of wetlands species restricted to serpentine and ultramafic substrates,soils that have unusually high calclium to magnesium rations. These sites remain moist or wet throughout the year and may have substantial sphagnum accumulation. Some may be bogs in the sense of nutrients and moisture primarily coming from rainfall, or more commonly they are seeps or fens maintained by groundwater discharge. The acidic (6.5-6.7 pH) and nutrient-poor substrates produce severe nitrogen deficiency which favors insectivorous plants. Characteristic plant species include California darlingtonia, roundleaf sundew, few-flower spikerush, fringed cotton-grass, California sedge, and tufted hairgrass. Around the edges of these fens Port Orford-cedar can occur and form part of the fen. Fens are important habitat for rare species that respond positively to burning.
1	CONUS	396	396	02.C.4.D029M063E396	9504	Mediterranean California Subalpine-Montane Fen	"This system is found in montane to subalpine elevations confined to specific environments defined by groundwater discharge, soil chemistry, and peat accumulation. This system includes ""extreme rich"" (alkaline, high in nutrients and plant diversity)  fens which are quite rare. Fens form at low points in the landscape or near slopes where groundwater intercepts the soil surface. Groundwater inflows maintain a fairly constant water level year-round, with water at or near the surface most of the time. Constant high water levels lead to accumulation of organic material. They are often dominated by species of sedge, birch, bog sedge, or bulrush. The surrounding landscape may be ringed with other wetland systems, e.g., streamside shrublands, or a variety of upland systems from grasslands to forests."
1	CONUS	397	397	02.C.4.D029M063E397	9502	North Pacific Bog and Fen	These  wetlands have year-around water and deep peat soils, most often found as openings in meadows, on slopes,  or along rivers and streams in northwest rainforests.  They are relatively abundant in Alaska and British Columbia but diminish rapidly in size and number farther south.  Wetland shrubs, water tolerant trees, and wildflower herbs occur but no single species or suite of species is particularly typical.   What is common is usually a mix of conifer-dominated swamp, shrub swamp, and open moss or sedge mire.  Many species common to boreal continental bogs and fens occur here, such as labrador-tea,  bog blueberry  and small cranberry. However, it is also distinguished from the boreal by the presence of Pacific coastal species, including Alaska yellow-cedar, Shore pine, Sitka spruce, Western Hemlock, Western red-cedar, salal,  Sitka sedge, Lyngbye's sedge, and California darlingtonia. In addition, many rare wildflower species can occur in bogs and fens.

Fens form at low points in the landscape or on slopes where groundwater intercepts the soil surface. Groundwater inflows maintain a fairly constant water level year-round, with water at or near the surface most of the time. Cold temperatures and constant high water levels lead to accumulation of organic material (i.e. peat). Fens can be ""rich"", which means alkaline and full of minerals, with many plant species, to ""poor"" which are acidic, nutrient poor, and have fewer species. Fens can be dominated by aquatic sedge, mud sedge, wiregrass sedge, swamp birch, Pacific bog sedge, simple bog sedge, and Rolland's leafless-bulrush. The surrounding landscape may be ringed with other wetland systems, e.g., streamside shrublands, or a variety of upland systems from grasslands to forests.  Many rare and endemic species can be found in fen habitats."
1	CONUS	399	399	02.C.4.D029M065E399	9207	Atlantic Coastal Plain Peatland Pocosin	This system includes wetlands of organic soils on the outer terraces of the coastal plain from  southeastern Virginia to  the Carolinas. Occurring on broad flats or gentle basins, the vegetation is predominantly dense shrubland and very shrubby open woodlands. A characteristic suite of primarily evergreen shrubs, greenbriars, and pond pine dominates. These shrubs include inkberry, fetterbush, staggerbush, littleleaf titi, big gallberry, and honeycups, along with laurel greenbrier. Pond pine is the characteristic tree, along with loblolly-bay, sweetbay, and swamp bay. Herbs are scarce and largely limited to small open patches. Under pre-European settlement fire regimes, stands of switch cane (canebrakes) would have been more common and extensive. Soil saturation, sheet flow, and peat depth create a distinct zonation, with the highest stature woody vegetation on the edges and lowest in the center. Catastrophic fires are important in this system, naturally occurring at moderate frequency. Fires generally kill all above-ground vegetation in large patches, which recovers rapidly in most of the burned areas, primarily by sprouting.

These sites occur at elevations below 4000 feet in poorly drained bottomlands on soils which are often saturated and mucky. Wetness results from a combination of groundwater input, seepage from adjacent slopes, rainfall and impeded drainage. Vegetation is at least partially open, typically a complex of patches of herbaceous-dominated areas as well as shrub thickets and often forested zones. The wettest areas have herbaceous vegetation dominated by sedges. Scattered trees and shrubs may be present in the herbaceous zones. Most examples also have a dense shrub zone around the edges. Some examples have forest zones as well, around the edges or as a matrix in which numerous small herbaceous openings are embedded. Hemlock, red maple, black gum, and pitch pine are characteristic trees. Characteristic shrubs include great rhododendron, smooth alder, nannyberry, and poison sumac.

This system occurs where there is adequate river flow and discharge to maintain fresh to oligohaline conditions, while still within tidal range. These marshes most often occur well inside the mouths of tidal creeks and rivers. Elevation differences within the marsh correspond to the occurrence of different vegetation types.
1	CONUS	402	402	02.C.5.D030M066E402	9230	Atlantic Coastal Plain Embayed Region Tidal Freshwater Marsh	These tidal freshwater marshes of the embayed region from southernmost Virginia and North Carolina are characterized by fresh to oligohaline waters driven by irregular wind tides, with minimal lunar tidal influence. They are the predominant marsh system in the drowned creeks and inland estuary shores of the embayed region. This system typically occurs as complexes dominated by large graminoids such as salt hay, bulrushes, cattails, and rushes,  sometimes with species-rich associations of shorter graminoids, forbs, and floating or submerged aquatics. Irregular flooding and fire are both important forces in this system, and rising sea level is a particularly important driver of long-term trends.
1	CONUS	403	403	02.C.5.D030M066E403	9233	Atlantic Coastal Plain Northern Fresh and Oligohaline Tidal Marsh	These freshwater tidal marshes occur on the upper reaches of large rivers influenced by tidal flooding beyond the reach of saltwater.  They are especially well developed on the Chesapeake and Delaware Bay drainages, and extend northeast to include portions of the Hudson River, Connecticut River, Merrimack River, Kennebec River and their tributaries, among others.  The vegetation includes marshes dominated by tall grasses such as wild rice; marshes of lower stature dominated by forbs such as water hemp, rosemallow, and others; and vegetation characterized by ground-hugging rosette-forming herbs such as estuary pipewort and riverbank quillwort.  Sediments of more protected spots are comprised of finer-grained materials that are poorly drained, or of well-consolidated peat deposits.  Areas with greater flooding force and scouring action have coarser mineral substrates such as sand and gravel.
1	CONUS	404	404	02.C.5.D030M066E404	9232	Florida Big Bend Fresh-Oligohaline Tidal Marsh	This system includes tidal freshwater and oligohaline marshes of the northern Gulf of Mexico along the Florida Big Bend area (roughly from Wakulla County to the Pasco/Hernando county line on Florida's west coast). The tidal range in this region is higher than in the western Panhandle, and wave energy is low; lunar, wind and seasonal tides make flooding irregular (Montague and Wiegert 1990). In comparison to the matrix-forming salt and brackish marshes of the same region, this system is confined to small patches that are generally restricted to areas near the mouths of rivers where freshwater is abundant.
1	CONUS	405	405	02.C.5.D030M067E405	9716	Atlantic Coastal Plain Depression Pondshore	This system consists of wetlands in small basins formed in unconsolidated sediments of the coastal plain from southeastern Virginia to Florida. Most basins are formed by subsidence of surface sediments caused by solution in underlying limestone. Others may be formed as swales in mainland eolian sands or natural blockage of small drainages by sediment movement. Soils are generally sandy, with mucky surfaces in the wettest areas. Vegetation is often zonal in response to variation in duration of flooding: open water or floating-leaved aquatics in the center of the deepest basins, emergent marsh zones in semipermanent water, drawdown zones with diverse small graminoid and forb vegetation,and dense shrub or woodland edges. A smaller number of basins may have emergent trees throughout. Hydroperiod can vary substantially from year to year, and vegetation can similarly vary. Besides flooding and its variation, fire is an important natural force in the outer drier portions.
1	CONUS	406	406	02.C.5.D030M067E406	9215	Atlantic Coastal Plain Large Natural Lakeshore	This system consists of wetland vegetation along large natural lakeshores in the Outer Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States. Natural lakes are generally rare features throughout most of this region. However, examples range northward to the Atlantic Coastal Plain in southeastern Virginia and North Carolina, but no examples are known from South Carolina and Georgia. However examples are present in Florida, where they are apparently found on smaller lakes than those to the north. Hydroperiod remains relatively constant from year to year, especially when compared to smaller limesink depressions of the region. Vegetation may appear to be zonal in relationship to distance from the lakeshore and may range from open water or floating-leaved aquatics in the deeper waters of the lakes, to emergent marsh zones along the edges. In some cases there are wet hardwood swamps present.
1	CONUS	407	407	02.C.5.D030M067E407	9712	Central Florida Herbaceous Pondshore	This system includes a variety of seasonal depression ponds in central Florida, especially along the Lake Wales Ridge. Examples are rounded or irregularly shaped, shallow depressions from tens to hundreds of meters in diameter (Abrahamson et al. 1984). Extensive variation is present based on the variety of soils and resultant hydroperiods. Most examples exhibit some zonation in vegetation and nearly all are ringed by saw palmetto. Characteristic or dominant species associated with the interior of the ponds include maidencane, cut-throat panicgrass, Arcadian St. John's-wort, and short-spike bluestem.
1	CONUS	408	408	02.C.5.D030M067E408	9231	Central Florida Herbaceous Seep	This system includes herbaceous seepage wetlands and nearly treeless plains over poorly drained soils in central Florida. Although examples of this system are similar to other wetland ecological systems, these are characterized by the presence of subtropical plant species not occurring in herbaceous-dominated wetlands farther north, especially cut-throat panicgrass. At least some examples have dense cover of grasses and low shrubs, with fairly rich species composition. Examples may be most common along the southern part of the Lake Wales Ridge area.
1	CONUS	409	409	02.C.5.D030M067E409	9603	East Gulf Coastal Plain Savanna and Wet Prairie	"This ecological system of western Florida and adjacent Alabama and Mississippi, may be considered a ""lush grassland"" (Kindell et al. 1997), ""grass-sedge savannah"" (Clewell 1981), wet prairie (FNAI 1990), or wet savanna (Collins et al. 2001). As implied by these names, this system consists of primarily herbaceous vegetation with relatively thick cover of grasses and sedge species. Examples occupy low, flat plains on poorly drained soils, often saturated for 50-100 days per year. Frequent fires, including growing-season burns, are essential for maintenance of this system. Some examples have a sparse tree component of slash pine or longleaf pine and scattered shrubs, such as wax-myrtle."
1	CONUS	410	410	02.C.5.D030M067E410	9713	East Gulf Coastal Plain Southern Depression Pondshore	This small-patch system occupies rounded depressions in the southern portions of the East Gulf Coastal Plain.  Most examples occur in the near-coastal flatlands (sensu Peet and Allard 1993) and tend to occupy basins that were formed by subsidence of surface sediments caused by solution in underlying limestone or as swales in eolian sand deposits.  Soils are generally sandy in basins of both types or origin.  Hydroperiod can vary substantially from year to year, and vegetation can similarly vary significantly in aspect and dominants.  Fire is an important natural force in the outer, drier portions of many examples, and periodic fires may sweep through the interior during dry periods.  Vegetation may exhibit distinct zonation in response to variation in duration of flooding.  Communities can range from floating aquatic types (in the centers of the deepest basins) to emergent herbaceous zones (in semipermanent water drawdown zones) to sparse, yet diverse, small graminoid and forb herbaceous vegetation to bald cypress woodland edges.  Some examples may have emergent trees throughout their extent.
1	CONUS	411	411	02.C.5.D030M067E411	9223	Floridian Highlands Freshwater Marsh	This system represents non-tidal marsh vegetation in the peninsula of Florida and in the Tallahassee area. These highland marshes occupy different types of depressions such as former lake basins, shallow peat-filled valleys, and zones around existing natural lakes (Kushlan 1990). The marshes and the basins they occur within are unstable over time due to subsurface subsidence and drainage pattern changes. In some examples, surface waterflow is generally lacking due to the presence of limestone near the surface, but water levels have fluctuated greatly over time (Patton and Judd 1986). Soils range from mucky surfaces to sandy loams or sands, but slowly permeable subsoils contribute to the presence of standing water for much of the year. The vegetation mosaic includes a range of mostly herbaceous plant communities that may be referred to as marshes, meadows, and prairies, collectively comprising a relatively diverse number of associations. Permanent water bodies support a range of submerged and floating aquatic species. Areas with approximately a meter of standing water tend to support dense stands of emergent herbaceous perennials, often in monospecific stands; species include broadleaf cattail, pickerelweed, American lotus, and others. Where there is less water (usually present only during wet season), more graminoid vegetation is present, with species such as maidencane, southern cutgrass, and other species. With historic water level fluctuations, the vegetation mosaic has also changed, sometimes quite rapidly.
1	CONUS	412	412	02.C.5.D030M067E412	9241	Southern Coastal Plain Herbaceous Seepage Bog	This small-patch ecological system includes wet, fire-maintained, seepage communities in the outermost portions of the East Gulf Coastal Plain, east of the Mississippi River in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and extending across northern Florida. These wetlands are generally found on gentle, almost imperceptible slopes maintained by constant seepage zones and/or perched water tables. Examples are typically grass and sedge dominated, and are often species-rich. Pitcher plants (pitcherplant spp.) are notable indicators of many community types in this system. Shrubs frequently encroach in the absence of fire; due to greater topographic isolation, the most interior examples are often naturally shrubbier.

1	CONUS	416	416	02.C.5.D030M069E416	9222	Central Interior and Appalachian Shrub-Herbaceous Wetland Systems	This systems group is typically found on glacial potholes, along small streams, ponds, channels in glacial outwash and on lakeplains. These wetlands consist of deep to shallow areas of freshwater marsh dominated by emergent and submergent species that may be surrounded by a zone of wet meadow. Stands may be open ponds with floating or rooted aquatics, deep marsh with bulrush or cattails, or wet meadow. They range in size from fairly small to several acres. The hydric soils are flooded by water at depths of several centimeters to over 1 meter for most of the growing season. Emergent marsh species such as Typha spp. and Schoenoplectus spp. dominate the core of this system, with an occasional scattering of tall Carex spp. and forbs that can vary from dense to open cover. Wet meadows can surround the emergent marsh core along wet mineral soils or shallow peat with the water table typically just below the surface for most of the growing season. The vegetation in the wet meadow zone is dominated by sedges (Carex spp.) and grasses such as Calamagrostis canadensis. These systems also can contain a zone of wet prairie species such as Spartina pectinata. Shrub swamps can also be associated with the wet meadows within these systems. Typical shrub species include Cornus spp., Salix spp., and/or Cephalanthus occidentalis. Trees are generally absent and, if present, are scattered.
1	CONUS	417	417	02.C.5.D030M069E417	9221	Great Lakes Coastal Marsh Systems	This systems group is found throughout the Great Lakes Basin in the United States and Canada. It can include a complex variety of wetlands occurring along the Great Lakes shorelines, as well as portions of tributary rivers and streams that are directly affected by Great Lakes water regimes. It also forms much of the St. Clair River delta. Species distributions and community patterns are determined by multiple abiotic factors, including the type of aquatic system (lakeshore, major river channels, smaller tributary rivers, major deltas, or estuarine), Great Lakes water-level fluctuations, surficial bedrock, glacial landform, climate, and land use. Although wetland species are generally widely distributed, those of more temperate prairie regions are found in the southern parts of the basin, while those of more boreal and subarctic regions are found in the northern parts of the basin. Vegetation types found across this diverse set of abiotic factors can be placed into a number of zones, though not all are present at a given site. The first four zones are typically inundated directly by lake waters: (a) submergent marsh - containing submergent and/or floating vegetation; (b) emergent marsh - characterized by shallow water or semipermanently flooded soils, and typically dominated by bulrushes, cattails, and other emergent species, but also containing submergent and/or floating vegetation; (c) shore fen - saturated vegetation mats characterized by groundwater influence from shoreline habitats but affected by lake-level fluctuations, and dominated by herbaceous or shrubby species; and (d) shoreline or strand - a narrow zone at or just above the water level where seasonal water-level fluctuations and waves cause erosion, and which is dominated by annual or pioneer herbaceous species. The next set of zones are inland from the water's edge and include: (e) herbaceous and shrubby wet meadows - characterized by saturated or seasonally flooded soils, and typically dominated by sedges, grasses, and other herbs, but occasionally dominated by shrubs; and (f) shrub or wooded swamps - characterized by seasonal flooding and dominated by woody species. Species assemblages in these zones change depending on the interaction of factors across the Great Lakes Basin. These systems can be divided into a number of geographical variants, based on the various community types found across the range of the system: (1) Lake Michigan Lacustrine Estuary; (2) Lake Erie-St. Clair Lakeplain Marsh; (3) Lake Ontario Lagoon Marsh; (4) St. Lawrence River Estuary; (5) Lake Superior Poor Fen; (6) Northern Rich Fen; (7) Northern Great Lakes Marsh; (8) Green Bay Disturbed Marsh; and (9) Saginaw Bay Lakeplain Marsh.
1	CONUS	419	419	02.C.5.D030M069E419	9242	Laurentian-Acadian Freshwater Marsh	These freshwater emergent and/or submergent marshes are dominated by herbaceous vegetation. They are common throughout the northeastern and north-central United States. Freshwater marshes occur in basins that are most often flat-bottomed and shallow, or forming a ring around the edge of deeper basins. They are associated with lakes, ponds, slow-moving streams, impoundments or ditches. Except for old cattaiil stalks, the herbaceous vegetation does not persist through the winter. Scattered shrubs are often present. Trees are generally absent and, if present, are widely scattered. The substrate is typically well decomposed organic muck over mineral soil.  Typical plants include cattails, marsh fern, touch-me-not, pondweeds, water lilies, pickerelweed, and tall rushes such as chairmaker's bulrush.
1	CONUS	420	420	02.C.5.D030M069E420	9224	Laurentian-Acadian Shrub-Herbaceous Wetland Systems	This systems group includes non-forested wetlands that are found in wet basins (closed or open), pondshores, and streamshores throughout the Northeast to the Great Lakes and upper Midwest, and in adjacent Canada. Many occur in association with larger lakes or streams. In shallow basins with particularly nutrient-poor and acidic conditions, Sphagnum-based fens develop; other settings develop as mineral-soil marshes. In areas of more-or-less permanent standing water, freshwater marshes with herbaceous vegetation are characteristic. Shrub swamps and fen vegetation typically include areas of graminoid dominance and shrub dominance, and scattered stunted trees may be present. Freshwater marshes, with non-persistent herbaceous vegetation, are associated with lakes, ponds, slow-moving streams, and/or impoundments or ditches. Scattered shrubs may be present but usually total less than 25% cover. The substrate is typically muck over mineral soil. Typical species in some freshwater marsh communities include Typha latifolia, Typha angustifolia, Phragmites australis, Schoenoplectus americanus, Thelypteris palustris, Impatiens capensis, Carex spp., Potamogeton spp., Nuphar advena (= Nuphar lutea ssp. advena), and Nymphaea odorata. Where standing water does not persist through the season, shrub swamps and wet meadows develop, varying from small pockets to extensive acreages. They often have a patchwork of shrub and graminoid dominance; typical species include Salix spp., Cornus amomum, Cornus sericea, Alnus incana, Spiraea alba, Calamagrostis canadensis, tall Carex spp., and Juncus effusus. Trees are generally absent and, if present, are scattered; Acer rubrum is typical.  An especially distinctive (and rare) expression within this systems group are the ribbed bogs or fens in which a pattern of narrow (2- to 3-m wide), low (less than 1 m deep) ridges are oriented at right angles to the direction of the drainage (National Wetlands Working Group 1988). Wet pools or depressions occur between the ridges. They develop almost entirely north of 46 degrees N latitude in east-central Canada and the adjacent U.S. They are minerotrophic peatlands in which the vegetation has developed into a pattern of strings (raised, usually linear features) and flarks (wet depressions separating the strings). These peatlands usually develop in open basins and flat plains, and the patterned portion may occupy only a fraction of the entire peatland.
1	CONUS	421	421	02.C.5.D030M069E421	9234	Northern Great Lakes Coastal Marsh	This system is found throughout the northern Great Lakes Basin in the United States and Canada. This system, which can include many associated wetlands, occurs along the Great Lakes shoreline directly affected by Great Lakes water regimes. Species distributions and community patterns are determined by multiple abiotic factors, including Great Lakes water-level fluctuations, surficial bedrock, glacial landform, climate, and land use. Vegetation types found across this diverse set of abiotic factors vary in any number of ways, but they can be placed into a number of zones, though not all are present at a given site. The first four zones are typically inundated directly by lake waters: (a) submergent marsh; (b) emergent marsh; Â© shore fen; and (d) shoreline or strand. The next set of zones are inland from the water's edge and include: (e) herbaceous and shrubby wet meadows and (f) shrub or wooded swamps.
1	CONUS	422	422	02.C.5.D030M071E422	9605	Eastern Great Plains Wet Meadow, Prairie, and Marsh	Eastern Great Plains marshes are found along creeks and streams or in depressions or along lake borders from eastern North Dakota to western Illinois and south to northern Texas.  They can be adjacent to floodplains but do not receive regular flooding from the river or stream.  They can range from having water in the soil just below the soil surface to water a few feet deep and tend to  have fine textured soils, often silty, dense clays or muck.  The vegetation is typically dense characterized by prairie cordgrass, eastern gammagrass, numerous large sedges, and in wetter areas, spikerush. Other tall marsh species such as cattail can be associated with this system.  Some parts of this system may be saline and have species such as saltgrass and saltmarsh clubrush. Fire has been the primary influence keeping these wet areas free of trees. Many areas have been converted to agriculture, but this usually requires some sort of drainage.
1	CONUS	423	423	02.C.5.D030M071E423	7402	Great Lakes Wet-Mesic Lakeplain Prairie	These prairies are found on the lakeplain near the southern central Great Lakes of the United States and Canada. Stands occur on level landscapes where the surface soil does not retain water well (i.e. sands or sandy loams) but where a layer of silty clay soil beneath the surface impedes complete drainage of the area.  There are often temporary inundations after heavy rains or in the spring, followed by dry conditions throughout much of the remaining growing season. These prairies are dominated by tallgrass species typically 1-2 m high. Trees and shrubs are very rare.  Areas around Chicago and Detroit were likely in this system but are heavily converted now and few sites remain.
1	CONUS	424	424	02.C.5.D030M071E424	9705	Great Plains Prairie Pothole	Prairie potholes are found in the glaciated northern Great Plains of the United States and Canada, and are characterized by depressional wetlands formed by glaciers scraping the landscape during the Pleistocene era.  Many of the prairie potholes are closed basins and receive irregular inputs of water from their surroundings.  Thus, water levels can vary substantially from season-to-season and year-to-year and the wetland vegetation expands and contracts in response to these changes.  Prairie potholes include elements of marshes and wet sedge meadows that develop into a pattern of concentric rings. Bulrushes, cattails, and sedges are prominent.  Prairie potholes are responsible for a significant percentage of the annual production of many economically important waterfowl and house more than 50% of North American's migratory waterfowl.  Much of the original extent of prairie potholes have been converted to agriculture and only approximately 40-50% remain undrained.
1	CONUS	425	425	02.C.5.D030M071E425	9710	Western Great Plains Closed Depression Wetland	This system includes the playa lakes of the western Great Plains and the rainwater basins in Nebraska. They are primarily upland depressional basins typified by the presence of an impermeable layer such as a dense clay, hydric soil and is usually recharged by rainwater and nearby runoff. They are rarely linked to outside groundwater sources and do not have an extensive watershed. Ponds and lakes associated with this system can experience periodic drawdowns during drier seasons and years, and are often replenished by spring rains. Species richness can vary considerably among individual examples of this system and is especially influenced by adjacent land use, which is often agriculture, and may provide nutrient and herbicide runoff. The vegetation is short (usually < 20 cm tall) and typically includes western wheatgrass, spikesedge, foxtail barley, meadow barley, and/or prostrate knotweed. Dynamic processes that affect these depressions are hydrological changes, grazing, and conversion to agricultural use.
1	CONUS	426	426	02.C.5.D030M071E426	9706	Western Great Plains Depressional Wetland Systems	This systems group includes wetlands that form in upland and lowland depressions across the western Great Plains. Isolated depression wetlands (including playa lakes) form in small basins within upland landscapes that are rarely linked to outside groundwater sources and do not have an extensive watershed. Open depression wetlands form in lowlands, including lake borders and stream margins, that have more open basins, usually have a larger watershed, and a permanent water source throughout most of the year (except during exceptional drought years). The isolated depressions are typified by the presence of an impermeable layer such as a dense clay, hydric soil and are usually recharged by rainwater and nearby runoff. Isolated ponds and lakes can experience periodic drawdowns during drier seasons and years and are often replenished by spring rains. Eleocharis spp., Hordeum jubatum, and common forbs such as Coreopsis tinctoria, Symphyotrichum subulatum (= Aster subulatus), and Polygonum pensylvanicum (= Polygonum bicorne) are common vegetation in the wetter and deeper depressions, while Pascopyrum smithii and Buchloe dactyloides are more common in shallow depressions in rangeland. Open depression wetlands include submergent and emergent marshes with Typha spp. and Schoenoplectus spp., and associated wet meadows and wet prairies. In areas of saline soils, both isolated and open depressions will be more brackish, with associated vegetation differences. Salt encrustations can occur on the surface in some depressions, and the soils are severely affected and have poor structure. Species that typify these systems are salt-tolerant and halophytic species such as Distichlis spicata, Sporobolus airoides, and Hordeum jubatum. Other commonly occurring taxa include Puccinellia nuttalliana, Salicornia rubra, Suaeda calceoliformis, Spartina spp., and shrubs such as Sarcobatus vermiculatus and Krascheninnikovia lanata.
1	CONUS	427	427	02.C.5.D030M071E427	9707	Western Great Plains Open Freshwater Depression Wetland	This Great Plains emergent marsh ecological system is composed of lowland depressions.  It also occurs along lake borders that have more open basins and a permanent water source through most of the year, except during exceptional drought years. These areas have a large watershed and/or significant connection to the groundwater table. The system includes submergent and emergent marshes and associated wet meadows and wet prairies. These types can also drift into stream margins that are more permanently wet and linked directly to the basin via groundwater flow from/into the pond or lake.  Hydrology is the primary process influencing this system. Grazing and conversion to agriculture can significantly impact the hydrology and species composition of this system.
1	CONUS	428	428	02.C.5.D030M165E428	9828	Cumberland Riverscour	"Examples of this riverscour-influenced system may occur on high-gradient and very high-gradient streams in the gorges of the Cumberland Plateau, the Cumberland Mountains, and the more rugged parts of the Ridge and Valley, extending north to southern West Virginia.  The succession of trees is retarded by the force of ""flashy,"" high-velocity water.  This system may occur on flood-scoured acidic or calcareous bedrock, cobble, pebble, or sandbar substrates of sandstone, limestone, dolomite, and possibly other sedimentary and weakly metamorphosed geologies. The most distinctive parts of the system are dominated by shrubs, prairie grasses, and forbs. Some areas develop a riparian woodland composed of river birch and sycamore. Some common shrubs include  smooth alder, river birch, bubttonbush, silky dogwood, Virginia sweetspire, smooth azalea, poison ivy, and red-cedar.  Prairie grasses are characteristic, including big bluestem, Indian grass, little bluestem, Indian woodoats, eastern gamagrass, and swithgrass. This system is affected by flood-scouring in some areas and deposition in others. There is typically a gradient from dry, nutrient-poor conditions upslope to moist and relatively enriched conditions downslope. Flood-scouring is a powerful and ecologically important abrasive force along the riverbanks where this system is found."
1	CONUS	429	429	02.C.5.D031M073E429	9403	Inter-Mountain Basins Interdunal Swale Wetland	This ecological system occurs within dune fields in the Intermountain western U.S. as small (usually less than 0.1 ha) interdunal wetlands that occur in wind deflation areas, where sands are scoured down to the water table. Small ponds may be associated. The water table may be perched over an impermeable layer of caliche (hardened calcium) or clay or, in the case of the Great Sand Dunes of Colorado, a geologic dike that creates a closed basin that traps water. These wetland areas are typically dominated by common emergent herbaceous vegetation such as species of spikerush, rush, and bulrush. Dune field ecological processes distinguish these emergent wetlands from similar non-dune wetlands.

These are seasonally wet, tall shrublands, often dense and impenetrable.  Sitka alder, vine maple, and thimbleberry are the most common shrubs, but young or broken-off trees such as Alaska cedar, or other shrubs and tall wildflowers make up lush to open growth on these steep slopes. Some slopes are not wet and are only covered in grasses.  These are quite distinct, but often too narrow to map well. Avalanche chutes can be quite long, extending from the subalpine into the montane and foothill toeslopes.
1	CONUS	431	431	02.C.5.D031M073E431	9226	North Pacific Intertidal Freshwater Wetland	This system occurs throughout the coastal margin and intertidal zone of the Pacific Northwest Coast, from Cook Inlet, Alaska, south to the central coast of Oregon. Intertidal freshwater wetlands occur as narrow strips to more extensive patches along the tidally influenced portions of coastal rivers. The plant species dominating these wetlands are not well studied, but the dominant species include Sitka spruce, red alder, Lyngbye's sedge, red-osier dogwood, western water-milfoil, narrowleaf cattail, and common ladyfern. This system is driven by daily tidal flooding of freshwater rivers, and the kinds of plant commuities are varied and depend on substrate characteristics and the tidal flooding regime of particular sites.

These are dominated by emergent herbaceous species, usually sedges, rushes, bull-rush, spikerush, or cattail. They are called emergent because the plants are rooted in the mud at the bottom of the lake or pond, and ""emerge"" through the water surface.  Red-wing black birds can be abundant in the spring in these habitats."
1	CONUS	433	433	02.C.5.D031M073E433	3402	Temperate Pacific Freshwater Mudflat	Freshwater mudflats are found scattered throughout the temperate regions of the Pacific Coast of North America. In the Pacific Northwest, they occur primarily in seasonally flooded shallow lakebeds on floodplains, especially along the lower Columbia River. During any one year, they may be absent because of year-to-year variation in river water levels. Mudflats must be exposed before the vegetation develops from seeds laying dormant in the soil.  When these annual plants appear, they range from open, sparsely vegetated  to extensive dense sods of herbaceous vegetation. The predominant species include blunt spikerush, western grasswort, water pygmyweed, awl-leaf mudwort, western marsh cudweed, creeping lovegrass, and marsh seedbox.
1	CONUS	434	434	02.C.5.D031M074E434	9708	Columbia Plateau Vernal Pool	Ephemeral ponds ringed by seasonal meadows with spectacular spring wildflower displays, this system of shallow  water bodies are mostly very small 3 square meters but can be quite large depressions square mile, and are known throughout the exposed volcanic scablands of the Columbia Plateau in Washington, Oregon, and northern Nevada.  Inundation is irregular, sometimes not occurring for several years. Depressions usually fill with rain water during winter and spring.  They typically have silty clay soils. Pools are often found within a mounded or biscuit-swale topography with sagebrush and open grassland or rarely Ponderosa pine savanna. In the northern Columbia Plateau, characteristic species are predominantly annual and diverse. Floristically akin to California vernal pool flora one-third, however, many of the most abundant species are not reported in Californian pools. Once they dry up, they can seemingly completely disappear, making them highly vulnerable.
1	CONUS	435	435	02.C.5.D031M074E435	9709	Northern California Claypan Vernal Pool	Shallow ephemeral ponds ringed by seasonal meadows with spectacular spring wildflower displays. these systems are shallow ephemeral water bodies found in depressions up to several hectares in size among grasslands and open woodlands throughout the northern Central Valley of California. Northern claypan vernal pools include a clay hardpan that retains water inputs throughout some portion of the spring, but typically the depression dries down entirely into early summer months. They tend to be circumneutral to alkaline and slightly saline wetlands. Due to draw-down characteristics, vernal pools typically form concentric rings of similar forb-rich vegetation. Given their relative isolation in upland-dominated landscapes, many endemic plant species are common in California vernal pools. Some years they remain completely dry, and in wet years, once they dry up, they can seemingly completely disappear, making them highly vulnerable.
1	CONUS	436	436	02.C.5.D031M074E436	9704	Northern Rocky Mountain Wooded Vernal Pool	These wooded vernal pools are small shallow  freshwater wetlands of glacial origin that partially or totally dry up as the growing season progresses. These sites are usually shallow and less than 1 m in depth, but can be as much as 2 m deep. The pools have a ring of trees surrounding the ponds that provide shade and influence their hydrology. A variety of tree species dominant the upper canopy, including grand fir, subalpine fir, western larch, Engelmann spruce, lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, and the broadleaf trees black cottonwood (black cottonwood), Oregon ash, and, to a lesser extent, quaking aspen (quaking aspen) and paper birch (paper birch). Common shrubs include speckled alder, red-osier dogwood, alderleaf buckthorn, and willow spp. Short-awn foxtail, greater water-starwort, inflated sedge (inflated sedge ), marsh spikerush, and reed canarygrass (reed canarygrass) are common herbaceous plant associates.
1	CONUS	437	437	02.C.5.D031M075E437	9609	Columbia Plateau Silver Sagebrush Seasonally Flooded Shrub-Steppe	This system occurs in poorly drained depressional wetlands, the largest characterized as playas, the smaller as vernal pools, or along seasonal stream channels in valley bottoms or mountain meadows. The name shrub-steppe refers to a shrubland with considerable herbaceous, mostly grass cover in between the shrub canopy. Bolander's silver sagebrush or mountain silver sagebrush are dominant, with basin big sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, or mountain big sagebrush occasionally codominant; shrubby-cinquefoil can also be codominant. Understory grass and grass-like plants  and wildflowers are characteristic, with curly bluegrass, Cusick's bluegrass, Idaho fescue, pullup muhly, mat muhly, and great basin lyme grass dominant at the drier sites; marsh spikerush, tufted hairgrass, and sedge species dominate at wetter or higher-elevation sites.
1	CONUS	438	438	02.C.5.D031M075E438	9606	Rocky Mountain Alpine-Montane Wet Meadow	These are high-elevation communities found throughout the Rocky Mountains and Intermountain regions, dominated by herbaceous species found on wet sites with very low-gradient surface and subsurface flows. They range in elevation from montane to alpine (1000-3600 m). They occur as large meadows in montane or subalpine valleys, as narrow strips bordering ponds, lakes, and streams, and along toeslope seeps. In alpine regions, sites typically are small depressions located below late-melting snow patches. Wet meadows are dominated by grasses, sedges or wildflowers, such as western bluejoint, white marsh-marigold, large mountain bittercress, small-head sedge, small-wing sedge, black alpine sedge, Holm's Rocky Mountain sedge, northwest territory sedge, native sedge, tufted hairgrass, few-flower spikerush, Drummond's rush, ice grass, yellowcress, arrowleaf ragwort, Parry's clover, and American globeflower.

It includes deciduous shrublands, dominated by different willow species (which vary by area and elevation), mountain alder, western birch,  with diverse low shrubs and forbs in the understory.  This system includes stream-side shrublands ranging from narrow stream borders in steep, V-shaped valleys and canyons, to broader floodplains in wide valley bottoms.  It also includes headwaters basins in the alpine to subalpine transition where willow shrublands can form dense thickets on the slopes, with small rivulets running throught them as winter snow melts.
1	CONUS	440	440	02.C.5.D031M075E440	9608	Temperate Pacific Montane Wet Meadow	These are montane and subalpine  wet meadows in open wet depressions, basins and flats among montane and subalpine forests found in the mountains of the Pacific coast, the Cascades and in the Sierra-Nevada range.  Usually dominated by sedges, grasses, and rushes, often with showy wildflowers such as camas, shooting star and hellebore.  These are flat, almost always found in forest openings, and often small. Sites are usually seasonally wet, often drying by late summer.
1	CONUS	441	441	02.C.5.D031M075E441	9607	Willamette Valley Wet Prairie	This system is largely restricted to the Willamette Valley of Oregon and adjacent Washington. These are high-nutrient wetlands that are flooded for short time spands, or for portions of the spring season. They are dominated primarily by grass and grass-like plants, especially tufted hairgrass, small camas, dense sedge, and one-sided sedge, and to a lesser degree by wildflowers such as Nuttall's quillwort or shrubs such as Nootka rose. Wet prairies historically covered large areas of the Willamette Valley where they were maintained by a combination of wetland soil, frequent flooding and burning in dry years. They have been reduced to tiny fragments of their former extent.
1	CONUS	442	442	02.C.5.D032M076E442	9610	Chihuahuan-Sonoran Desert Bottomland and Swale Grassland	This desert grassland occurs in relatively small depressions or swales and along drainages throughout the northern and central Chihuahuan Desert and into adjacent Sonoran Desert, as well as in limited areas of the southern Great Plains.  Stands occupy low topographic positions and receive runoff from adjacent areas during summer rainfall events. Water infiltrates into generally deep, fine-textured soils and produces lush vegetation.  These grasslands are typically dominated by tobosa grass [tobosa swales], alkali sacaton, or big alkali sacaton with other moisture-loving grasses such as western wheatgrass or vine-mesquite. With tobosa swales, sand-adapted species such as soaptree yucca may grow at the swale's edge in  sandy alluvium deposited there from upland slopes. Alkali sacaton and big alkali sacaton are more common in alkaline soils and along drainages.  Scattered shrubs such as fourwing saltbush, apache plume and honey mesquite [in degraded stands] may be present.
1	CONUS	443	443	02.C.5.D032M076E443	9227	North American Arid West Emergent Marsh	These are natural marshes that occur in depressions (ponds, kettle ponds), as fringes around lakes, and along slow-flowing streams and rivers (sloughs). They are frequently or continually flooded with water depths up to six feet deep, but have rooted, mostly grass-like plants.  They usually have peat or muck in the bottom, and this system occurs in dry environments, typically surrounded by savanna, shrub steppe, steppe, or desert vegetation. Common emergent and floating vegetation includes species of bulrush and/or bulrush, cattail, rush, pondweed, knotweed, pond-lily, and canarygrass.
1	CONUS	444	444	02.C.5.D032M076E444	9834	North American Warm Desert Riparian Mesquite Bosque	These mequite woodlands and forests occur along rivers and streams in valleys of southern Arizona and New Mexico, and adjacent Mexico.   The tree or tall shrub canopy is either honey mesquite and velvet mesquite with mulefat, arrow-weed, and coyote willow commonly present in a shrub layer.  Mesquites tree and other moisture-loving plants, tap groundwater below the streambed when surface flows stop. These plants are dependent upon annual rise in the water table for growth and reproduction.
1	CONUS	445	445	02.C.6.D033M077E445	9711	Western Great Plains Saline Depression Wetland	These salty or alkaline wetlands are found throughout the western Great Plains.  They can include shallow lakes and depressions, which usually hold water for part of the year, and for which water evaporates rather than runs off, creating the salty conditions.  Salt encrustations can occur on the surface in some examples of this system, and the soils are severely affected and have poor structure. Species that typify this system are salt-tolerant species such as saltgrass, alkali sacaton, and foxtail barley.  During exceptionally wet years, an increase in precipitation can dilute the salt concentration in the soils of some examples of this system which may allow for less salt-tolerant species to occur.  Conversion to agriculture and pastureland can impact this system, especially when it alters the hydrology of the system.
1	CONUS	446	446	02.C.6.D034M079E446	9101	Acadian Salt Marsh and Estuary Systems	"This systems group covers marshes of the Gulf of Maine and parts of the southern New England coastline, along the immediate ocean shore and near estuary mouths, where salinity regime is polyhaline to mesohaline. True salt marshes, sometimes called ""salt meadows,"" display strong graminoid dominance, with patchy forbs. Spartina patens and Spartina alterniflora are the major dominants. These marshes may be extensive where the local topography allows their development, which is primarily in the southern portion of the system's range (Merrymeeting Bay, Maine, southward). Eastward, where the coastal topography becomes more dissected, they are more commonly seen as a fairly narrow fringe along tidal shorelines. These salt marshes are typically less extensive and with some different floristic elements than the marshes southward along the Atlantic Coast from Cape Cod to Chesapeake Bay. Brackish marshes are found along mesohaline reaches of estuaries of the Gulf of Maine and parts of the southern New England coastline, and feature emergent and submergent vegetation. Dominance ranges from extensive grasslands (tall Schoenoplectus spp., etc.) to sparsely vegetated mudflats, all tidally influenced. Brackish marshes grade into the salt marshes at the mouth of estuaries."
1	CONUS	447	447	02.C.6.D034M079E447	9103	Atlantic Coastal Plain Central Salt and Brackish Tidal Marsh	This system encompasses the brackish to salt intertidal marshes of the Atlantic Coast, ranging from south of the Embayed Region of North Carolina to northern Florida (south to the vicinity of Daytona Beach). It is dominated by medium to extensive expanses of saltmarsh cordgrass, flooded twice daily by lunar tides. Black needlerush and other brackish marshes occur upstream in tidal creeks, and a variety of small-patch associations occur near the inland edges. Examples of this system may also support inclusions of shrublands dominated by either groundsel-tree and/or seaside oxeye, as well as forests or woodlands with coastal red-cedar in the overstory.
1	CONUS	448	448	02.C.6.D034M079E448	9105	Atlantic Coastal Plain Embayed Region Tidal Salt and Brackish Marsh	This system encompasses the intertidal marshes of the embayed region of southeastern Virginia and adjacent North Carolina. It is distinguished by the extensive brackish water and wind tidal flooding characteristic of that region. Low diversity marshes, often monospecific, are found on intertidal flats generally cut off from direct oceanic influence by a series of protective barrier islands. Embedded within the matrix of marshes are smaller salt pannes.
1	CONUS	449	449	02.C.6.D034M079E449	9104	Atlantic Coastal Plain Indian River Lagoon Tidal Marsh	"This tidally influenced marsh system of the Indian River Lagoon along Florida's Atlantic Coast supports approximately 10% of the salt marshes in Florida (Montague and Wiegert 1990). The bulk of these are ""high marshes"" wholly above mean high water levels. They are protected from direct exposure to the Atlantic Ocean by perched barrier islands, and consequently receive natural inundation only from wind tides and seasonal sea level changes. A berm or levee generally separates these high marshes from lower fringing marshes of saltmarsh cordgrass (to the north) and red mangrove (to the south). Landward of this berm, salt flats or hypersaline zones often develop with pickleweed, saltgrass, seaside oxeye, saltwort, and seashore crowngrass. In some areas these species occur in monospecific zones, while in others they co-occur, grading into occasional black mangrove. These zones are followed by a typical black needlerush zone, and the most inland fringes may be dominated by sand cordgrass. Marshes of this region have been heavily altered by mosquito control impoundments of the 1950s and 1960s."
1	CONUS	450	450	02.C.6.D034M079E450	9109	Atlantic Coastal Plain Northern Tidal Salt Marsh	"This system encompasses the intertidal marshes of the North Atlantic Coastal Plain from Chesapeake Bay north to Cape Cod, and sporadically to the mid-coastal Maine. It includes a number of different vegetation types including salt marshes, salt shrublands, and isolated salt ""pannes"" where only the most salt-tolerant species can grow. This system occurs on the bay (inner) side of barrier beaches and the outer mouth of tidal rivers where salinity is not much diluted by freshwater input. The typical salt marsh profile, from sea to land, features a low regularly flooded marsh strongly dominated by saltmarsh cordgrass; a higher irregularly flooded marsh dominated by saltmeadow cordgrass and saltgrass; low hypersaline pannes characterized by saltwort and other species; and a salt scrub ecotone characterized by marsh elder, groundsel-tree, and switchgrass. Salt marsh ""islands"" of slightly higher elevation also support eastern red-cedar. This system also includes the rare sea-level fens, which occur at the upper reaches of certain salt marshes where groundwater emerging from the uplands creates a distiinctive freshwater peatland."
1	CONUS	451	451	02.C.6.D034M079E451	9110	Florida Big Bend Salt-Brackish Tidal Marsh	This system represents salt and brackish marshes of the northern Gulf of Mexico along the Florida Big Bend (roughly from Wakulla County (Apalachicola Bay) to the Pasco/Hernando countyline (more or less to Tampa Bay) on Florida's west coast). The tidal range here is higher than in the western Panhandle, and wave energy is low; lunar, wind and seasonal tides make flooding irregular (Montague and Wiegert 1990). The bulk of these marshes are comprised of monospecific stands of black needlerush that often exhibit tall- and short-growth zones. Less common are patches of saltmarsh cordgrass, which may be confined to the edges of creeks or in other pockets of low elevation; small patches of saltgrass may also be present near berms or levees (Montague and Wiegert 1990).
1	CONUS	452	452	02.C.6.D034M079E452	9220	Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain Tidal Marsh Systems	"This systems group includes tidal marshes in various settings along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and barrier islands. Salt, brackish, and freshwater marshes are included. Regular tidal flooding occurs over most of the system, with irregular flooding in unusually high tides occurring in the upper zones. Tides bring nutrients, making the regularly flooded marshes fertile. Storms may push saltwater into brackish areas, acting as a disturbance to vegetation. The dominant factors in vegetation variability are salinity and geography. Salt marshes are often dominated by Spartina grasses, often forming large and low-diversity but high-productivity expanses. Juncus roemerianus is also common and, like Spartina, may be dominant over large areas. Local depressions in upper zones may be hypersaline due to concentration of salt by evaporation; Salicornia spp., Sarcocornia spp., and Distichlis spicata are characteristic in these salt pannes. In brackish settings, Spartina may be characteristic as well, but it is often mixed with or replaced by other graminoids such as Schoenoplectus spp. Brackish marshes may include large patches of flats with low forbs (along the northern Atlantic Coast); Sagittaria subulata and Limosella australis are typical. Fresh to oligohaline tidal marshes may be characterized by Zizania spp., Zizaniopsis miliacea, Eleocharis spp., Sagittaria spp., and Typha spp. They typically occur along bay margins near inflowing rivers, extending up the tidal reaches of those rivers.  While tidal marshes are characteristically herbaceous, they may support inclusions of shrublands dominated by Baccharis halimifolia, Borrichia frutescens, or other shrubs. Salt marsh ""islands"" of slightly higher elevation also support Juniperus virginiana. Fresh and oligohaline marshes can have a heterogeneous physiognomy including shrublands, grasslands, and aquatic herbs. Individual systems in this group are differentiated based on salinity, geography, and tidal dynamics and energy."

These marshes are typically associated with mud-bottomed bays behind barrier islands. Wind-dominated tides and low tidal amplitudes (<1 meter) characterize this region. This system includes predominately brackish marshes and supports what is probably the largest zone of black needlerush in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain outside of the North Carolina/Virginia Embayed Region estuarine marshes.
1	CONUS	454	454	02.C.6.D034M079E454	9604	Texas Saline Coastal Prairie	This system encompasses grassland vegetation occurring on saline soils that are often saturated by local rainfall and periodically flooded by saline waters during major storm events. It is located along the Gulf Coast of Texas. Saline prairie continues to occupy extensive areas, though quality of the system is often degraded by the invasion of woody shrubs due to the absence of regular fire. Fire is an important ecological process needed to maintain this system, though periodic submersion with saltwater during storm events also helps to control the invasion of woody species. This system is characteristically dominated by gulf cordgrass; other dominants may include seaside bluestem and hair-awn muhly. This system includes depressions often dominated by saltmeadow cordgrass.
1	CONUS	455	455	02.C.6.D035M081E455	9108	Temperate Pacific Tidal Salt and Brackish Marsh	This are coastal salt marshes found in bays and along rivers or streams near the ocean.  Most are found in the larger estuaries formed at the mouth of the large rivers, behind sand spits or other areas protected from waves.  Trhey often look quite uniform, but often comprise a diverstiy of sublte habitats, and are characterized by grasses, rushes, and wildflowers such as saltgrass, shoregrass, marsh rosemary, pickleweed, seep weed, saltwort, and others.   Marshes can have numerous small channels and streams throughout.  These areas are quite diverse, with different plants found in in places depending on the soils sandy, silty or muddy, and on how much freshwater occurs in relation to the salty bay water.
1	CONUS	456	456	02.C.6.D036M082E456	9714	Inter-Mountain Basins Alkaline Closed Depression	Permanent and seasonal wetlands, found in the closed basins of the intermountain west, or in other dry areas where water evaporates before it can run off.  These wetlands are often associated with seasonal or playa lakes, or occur on permanent lakes in closed basins.  They are flat, sometime large, sometimes small, usually dominated by sedges, rushes, and alkaline tolerant grasses.  Shrubs or trees are rarely found in these wetlands, except for occasional willows on lake or stream margins, and greasewood when these are found in poorly drained floodplains.
1	CONUS	457	457	02.C.6.D036M082E457	9810	Inter-Mountain Basins Greasewood Flat	"This ecological system occurs throughout much of the western U.S. in Intermountain basins.  These ""flats"" are usually found near drainages on stream terraces and flats or may form rings on the margins of playas and desert lakes.  Greasewood forms open tall shrublands sometimes alone, sometimes with other shrubs.  These are usually near salt-desert scrub communities, or big sagebrush shrublands or steppe (shrublands with high cover of grasses).  While many of these can be very sparse, seasonal moisture can support grasses, sometimes with fairly high cover, ranging from 6 foot basin wildrye to very low saltgrass.  In many places, black greasewood shrublands have been invaded by cheatgrass, which often outcompetes the native grasses and herbs, and increases the risk of wildfire.  When cheatgrass dies in late summer it easily catches fire, and can carry flames to the shrubs."
1	CONUS	458	458	02.C.6.D036M082E458	3407	Inter-Mountain Basins Playa	Barren, usually alkaline desert playas, are found in closed basins in the intermountain west.  These basins are intermittently (once every few years) or seasonally (every year) flooded, and water is prevented from percolating through the soil by an impermeable sub-surface layer and is left to evaporate.  Salt crusts and high salt in the soils greatly affects species composition.  While the appearance is barren, some species such as iodinebush, black greasewood, spiny hop-sage, Lemmon's alkali grass, great basin lyme grass, saltgrass, or saltbush occur around the margins of the playa.  This system grades into salt-desert scrub and sagebrush habitats.
1	CONUS	459	459	02.C.6.D036M083E459	3405	North American Warm Desert Playa	Desert playas are found across the warm deserts of North America, from western Texas to  southern California. Playas are depresions that are intermittently flooded, followed by evaporation, leaving behind a residue of salts.  Surface soils textures are variable but there is often an impermeable subsoil layer that keeps water near soil surface.  Bare ground and salt crusts are abundant on soil surface with small saltgrass beds in depressions and sparse shrubs around the margins.  Other common plants include iodinebush, seepweed, marsh spikerush, ricegrass, crinklemat, or saltbush. Occasionally, herbaceous plants may temporarily cover ground surface during wet periods, but then dry up and blow away.  Large desert playas tend to be defined by rings of plants formed in response to salt tolerance.  Playas are often sources areas for sand that is blown from playa to dunes downwind.
1	CONUS	460	460	03.A.1.D039M087E460	5211	Apacherian-Chihuahuan Mesquite Upland Scrub	These upland mesquite shrublands are common in foothills and plains in the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts.  Besides honey or velvet mesquite, other common shrubs are viscid acacia, mescat wattle, and junipers.  Creosotebush is absent or has low cover. Grass are usually sparse. During the last century, this shrubland as greatly expanded its range converting large area of  desert grasslands to mesquite desert scrub as a result of drought, overgrazing by livestock, and/or decreases in fire frequency.
1	CONUS	461	461	03.A.1.D039M087E461	5303	Apacherian-Chihuahuan Semi-Desert Grassland and Steppe	Diverse semi-desert grassland and steppe typical of the Borderlands of Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico [Apacherian region], but extends into the Chihuahuan and Chihuahuan deserts. It is found on gently sloping alluvial fans and plains below isolated desert mountains and on mesas and steeper piedmont and foothill slopes that supported frequent fire. This diverse grassland often includes scattered succulents, short and tall shrubs or small trees.  Common grass species include grama grass (black, blue, chino, hairy, Rothrock's, and sideoats), plains lovegrass, muhly (bull, bush, and curly-leaf), and James' galleta.  Succulents species of agave, sotol, yucca, and tall-shrub/short-tree species of acacia, mesquite, and various oaks (e.g., gray oak, Emory oak, Arizona white oak, Mexican blue oak) are usually present.  Many of the historical grassland and savanna areas have been converted to mesquite dominated scrub through intensive grazing and other land uses.
1	CONUS	462	462	03.A.1.D039M087E462	5201	Chihuahuan Creosotebush, Mixed Desert and Thorn Scrub	Creosotebush desert scrub occurs in desert basins and plains, alluvial flats, and lower alluvial fans and is is the most common vegetation in the Chihuahuan Desert.  It can be similar to the mixed desert and thorn scrub common in upper alluvial fans, gravelly slopes and mesas (but is less diverse).  This desert scrub occurs on lowland areas and plains with finer textured soil.  Tarbush is often present and occasionally may be more common than creasotebush.  Grasses are generally sparse.
1	CONUS	463	463	03.A.1.D039M087E463	5304	Chihuahuan Gypsophilous Grassland and Steppe	These uncommon shrub-steppes (grasslands with scattered shrubs), sparse grasslands and dwarf-shrublands are restricted to gypsum outcrops and gypsum soils that occur in desert  basins in the Chihuahuan Desert.  Few plants can grow in these harsh soils and many of these are only known from gypsum soils. Gypsum-loving plants include rough tiquilia, Hartweg's sundrops, James' sea-heath, gyp grama, and gyp dropseed.  Several wider ranging plants such as fourwing saltbush,Torrey's joint-fir, and alkali sacaton can tolerate gypsum soils and may also be present. Gypsum dunes such as at White Sands National Monument are not included in this type because the dune processes are more important than chemical composition of the sand.
1	CONUS	464	464	03.A.1.D039M087E464	7326	Chihuahuan Loamy Plains Desert Grassland	This desert grassland occurs in the northern Chihuahuan Desert and extends into limited areas of the southern Great Plains on alluvial flats, loamy plains, and basins sometimes extending up to foothill and lower mountain slopes. These grasslands are typically found on flat or gently sloping,   non-salty, finer textured (loams or clay loam) soils. This grassland is characterized by long lived  grasses and is typically dominated by tobosa grass and black grama  (more historically) or blue grama. In degraded stands, burrograss, low woolly grass, or threeawn spp. may codominate. James' galleta may become important in northern stands and blue grama in the southern Great Plains and on degraded examples.  Scattered shrubs such as tarbush, broom snakeweed, creosotebush, cane cholla, honey mesquite, and yucca may be present, especially on degraded grasslands.
1	CONUS	465	465	03.A.1.D039M087E465	5212	Chihuahuan Mixed Desert and Thorn Scrub	Extensive desert scrub that occurs on gravelly mid to upper bajadas, foothills and alluvial fans in the Chihuahuan Desert and has recently expanded into former desert grasslands in the northern portion of its range. It can be similar to the creosotebush desert scrub common in lower alluvial fans, and basins, but is usually more diverse and occurs on gravelly soils. Although creosotebush is common, many other shrub and succulents present may include Wright's beebrush, smooth sotol, tarbush, ocotillo, catclaw mimosa, and mariola.  If mesquite is present then it is not common.  Grass cover is variable.  Common grasses are grama grasses (sideoats, black, blue, hairy, chino),  low woolly grass, and bush muhly.
1	CONUS	466	466	03.A.1.D039M087E466	7303	Chihuahuan Sandy Plains Semi-Desert Grassland	This dry grasslands occur across the northern Chihuahuan Desert and extends into the southern Great Plains where soils have a high sand content, often occurring in sandy plains and on sandstone mesas. Typical grasses are black grama and mesa dropseed with other characteristic Chihuahuan species. Common plants include Indian ricegrass, purple three-awn, New Mexico needlegrass (minor), sand muhly, James' galleta, and sand dropseed. There are often scattered desert shrubs and  succulents present, such as Torrey's joint-fir, cane cholla, soaptree yucca, and Torrey's yucca, that are characteristic of the Chihuahuan Desert. The widespread shrub, sand sagebrush is also frequently present in northern extent, especially in degraded stands.
1	CONUS	467	467	03.A.1.D039M087E467	5203	Chihuahuan Stabilized Coppice Dune and Sand Flat Scrub	This desert scrub occurs as patches on small dunes and on sandsheets in the Chihuahuan Desert.   These open shrublands are composed of honey mesquite or sand sagebrush that colonized disturbed sandy plains and formed small (coppice) dunes as blowing sand is trapped and deposits beneath shrubs. Shrub will avoid burial by growing faster than sand deposition and form a dune.  Other plants that occur less frequently include fourwing saltbush, Torrey's joint-fir, hoary rosemarymint, and littleleaf sumac.  Soaptree yucca, broom snakeweed, and grasses,  black grama and mesa dropseed are frequently present. In northern stands, sand sagebrush dominates and honey mesquite become less uncommon or absent. This desert scrub is largely the result of conversion of degraded sandy desert grasslands in southern New Mexico.

In rolling terrain it is absent from cooler north slopes. Succulent plants are most common such as lechuguilla, candelilla, ocotillo, candy barrel cactus, cactus-apple, cane cholla,and turkshead.  Occasional shrubs like creosote or mariola are usually present.
1	CONUS	469	469	03.A.1.D039M087E469	5604	Madrean Juniper Savanna	This savanna is composed of dry grasslands with scattered juniper trees and is found in northern Mexico and extends north into plains and foothills  in Trans-Pecos Texas and southern New Mexico and Arizona. Madrean tree species such as redberry juniper and Pinchot's juniper are present along with other junipers forming a very open tall shrub/small tree layer. The most common grasses are blue grama and James' galleta.  Succulents such as species of yucca, pricklypear, and agave are often present.  In the last century, juniper savanna expansion into desert grasslands is significant in many areas.

This sparse to moderately dense shrubland is composed of creosotebush and white burrobush, but many different shrubs, dwarf-shrubs, and cacti may be present. Other common plants include desert-holly, brittlebush, Nevada joint-fir, ocotillo, and beavertail cactus.  Grass and herb cover is sparse, except during springs after above average winter rains when ephemeral annual plants carpet the desert floor.
1	CONUS	473	473	03.A.1.D039M088E473	5209	Sonoran Mid-Elevation Desert Scrub	This desert scrub occurs between northern edge of the Sonoran Desert and the chaparral dominated slopes of the Mogollon Rim/Central Highlands region in Arizona and on lower slopes of several desert ranges such as the Bradshaw, Hualapai, and Superstition mountains. Sites are found in a relatively narrow elevational band (750 -1300 m) that is too high/cold for the frost sensitive warm desert species such as saguaro and paloverde found in the ~Sonoran Paloverde-Mixed Cacti Desert Scrub (CES302.761)$$ and too dry for the chaparral species common in the ~Mogollon Chaparral (CES302.741)$$ ecological system.  Soils are generally rocky. Common species present are creosotebush, narrowleaf goldenbush, California wild buckwheat, and taller shrubs such as crucifixion-thorn or jojoba that form an open shrub layer.
1	CONUS	474	474	03.A.1.D039M088E474	5213	Sonoran Paloverde-Mixed Cacti Desert Scrub	This classic Sonoran mixed cacti warm desert scrub occurs on hillsides, mesas and plains in southern Arizona. Tall saguaros are the most conspicuous plants, but yellow paloverde and creosotebush are usually most common in the sparse to moderate shrub canopy.  Other shrubs such as  mesquite, desert-ironwood, catclaw acacia, fairy duster, and ocotillo are also common. Many cacti are present like  barrel cactus, hedgehog cactus, pricklypear and cholla. Grasses and herbs are generally sparse. In some areas, invasions of exotic grasses,  red brome, fountain grass and buffelgrass have provided fine fuels that now allow fire to burn and distroy vast areas of this fire-sensitive desert scrub.  Saguaros may grow to 16 m tall and provide homes for several birds. Gila woodpeckers and gilded flickers excavate nest holes, and Elf owls, Purple martins, cactus wrens use abandoned nests.  Many bats feed on saguaro flower necter (and pollinate flowers).

Stands often occur on alluvial flats and around playas, as well as in floodplains along the Rio Grande and Pecos rivers. Soils are generally fine-textured with high salt content. Common plants are fourwing saltbush, New Mexico saltbush, and species of pickleweed, seepweed, or other salt-loving plants. Grasses often include alkali sacaton, tobosa grass, or saltgrass at varying densities.  Salt crusts may form on ground surface.
1	CONUS	476	476	03.A.1.D039M090E476	5208	Sonora-Mojave Mixed Salt Desert Scrub	This warm desert scrub forms extensive open-canopied shrublands in salty soil basins in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts.  They are often found around playas (dry lakes) that occasionally fill following rain.  Soils are generally fine-textured (clays). Common shrubs are  fourwing saltbush, cattle-spinach, or other saltbushes.  Allenrolfea, pickleweed, seepweed, or other salt-loving plants are often present. The grasses, alkali sacaton and saltgrass may be present at varying densities.
1	CONUS	477	477	03.A.1.D039M092E477	9822	North American Warm Desert Wash	These intermittently flooded washes or arroyos often disect alluvial fans, mesas, plains and basin floors throughout the warm deserts of North America. Although often dry, the stream processes define this type, which are often associated with rapid sheet and gully flow. Desert wash plants may be sparse and patchy to moderately dense,  typically occurring along the banks, but occasionally within the channel.  Plants are quite variable but are mostly shrubs and small trees such as apache plume, black greasewood, catclaw acacia, desert-willow, desert almond, littleleaf sumac, and mesquite.  Washes are important habitat for many animals in the desert.
1	CONUS	478	478	03.A.1.D039M130E478	7509	South Texas Lomas	This system occurs on well-drained portions of clay dunes (lomas) rising above surrounding coastal tidal flats. It is a xeric, subtropical shrubland dominated by thorny evergreen shrubs, generally 2-4 m tall. Composition of this system is extremely variable, and there is usually no clear dominant, except locally. Local dominants may include Berlandier's fiddlewood, Texas barometer-bush, brazilwood spiny tree, and Texas ebony. While there is often no clear dominant, Spanish dagger is a constant and conspicuous emergent in many occurrences (Johnston 1952). Some lomas may be flooded by the sea during severe storm events. Vegetation in this system is sometimes influenced by salt spray, high winds, limited rooting depth, saline water table, and extreme xeric conditions. Soils are typically Point Isabel clay loam.
1	CONUS	479	479	03.A.1.D039M130E479	5217	Tamaulipan Calcareous Thornscrub	This xeric thornscrub ecological system is restricted to limestone and calcareous sandstone hills and caliche substrates such as along the Bordas Scarp in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico. Soils are shallow, alkaline, strongly calcareous and underlain by bedrock or a caliche layer. It has a shorter, more open shrub canopy (usually less than 2 m) when compared to more typical thornscrub growing on more favorable sites. However, shrub cover is generally greater than 70% and often greater than 85%. Dominant species include Texas barometer-bush, guajillo, and sweet acacia with many other shrub species that may be locally dominant such as blackbrush acacia, mountain torchwood, Texas torchwood, Texas goatbush, spiny hackberry, Texas kidneywood, barreta, allthorn, Texas paloverde, mescalbean, or yucca spp. The sparse to moderately dense herbaceous layer is dominated by perennial graminoids.
1	CONUS	480	480	03.A.1.D039M130E480	7323	Tamaulipan Clay Grassland	This Tamaulipan ecological system occurs on clay prairies near the Gulf Coast and drier sites further inland. Substrates are fine calcareous clays and clay loam. Occasional fires and root pruning from montmorillonitic clay limit shrub invasion, if the grassland is not overgrazed. If overgrazed the land will convert to stable thornscrub dominated by honey mesquite and spiny hackberry. Vegetation is dominated by perennial mid and short grasses such as little bluestem, crowngrass spp., multi-flower windmill grass, buffalograss, with other grasses such as plumed beardgrass, sideoats grama, slim-spike windmill grass, Texas needlegrass, tumble grass, streambed bristle grass, and clumps of big bluestem on less clayey sites. Honey mesquite or plateau live oak are often present as scattered mottes or are restricted to drainages. Texas prickly-pear is often present.
1	CONUS	481	481	03.A.1.D039M130E481	5216	Tamaulipan Mesquite Upland Scrub	This ecological system occurs throughout much of the lower Rio Grande plains and plateaus of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas. It is dominated by thorn scrub that was limited to rocky, broken uplands and drainages, but has become widespread in the last 100-150 years as the result of disturbance to adjacent mesquite savanna grasslands. Severe overgrazing in the mid-1800s, with subsequent shifts in fire processes and changes in edaphic conditions, has allowed this thornscrub ecological system to be the new steady-state. The vegetation is characterized by an open to dense tall-shrub layer dominated or codominated by honey mesquite with many other species present to codominate such as guajillo, sweet acacia, blackbrush acacia, mountain torchwood, Texas torchwood, spiny hackberry, Texas barometer-bush, pricklypear spp., Texas paloverde, yucca spp. and limestone prickly-ash. The herbaceous layer is generally sparse, but dense graminoids may dominate the herbaceous layer of stands with open shrub canopies or remnant patches of savanna.

It occurs on a variety of substrates and landforms. Dominant species include round-flower catclaw, Texas barometer-bush, and honey mesquite. Other species present to codominant include guajillo, sweet acacia, mountain torchwood, Texas torchwood, spiny hackberry, Texas paloverde, and cacti such as Texas prickly-pear.
1	CONUS	483	483	03.A.1.D039M130E483	7322	Tamaulipan Savanna Grassland	This Tamaulipan ecological system is dominated by perennial grasses with sparse overstory of mesquite or oak trees and thornscrub. Dominant grasses are Bermudagrass spp. This system was once common matrix system, but has largely been converted to desert scrub and exists as remnant patches. Degraded subtropical forests and woodlands may have similar structure, but is not included in this system because different ecological processes maintain it.
1	CONUS	484	484	03.B.1.D040M093E484	5703	Inter-Mountain Basins Mat Saltbush Shrubland	This ecological system occurs on gentle slopes and rolling plains in the northern Colorado Plateau and Uinta Basin on Mancos shale and arid, windswept basins and plains across parts of Wyoming.  These are stands of dwarf-shrubs (< 15 cm tall) and grasses, usually with < 25% plant canopy cover, that grow on gentle terrain with fine-textured, saline or shale soils.  The shrubs are pure or mixed stands of mat saltbush, Gardner saltbush, birdfoot sage, longleaf wormwood, bud sagebrush, or winterfat.  Grasses and herbs are not abundant; grasses include western wheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Sandberg bluegrass.  Woody aster usually is present and often is common as is Hood's phlox.  Other wildflowers may be present as well.  Taller shrubs, especially Wyoming big sagebrush and shadscale saltbush may be present but contribute little cover. Annual plants are seasonally present, with spring moisture or summer rainstorms.
1	CONUS	485	485	03.B.1.D040M093E485	5205	Inter-Mountain Basins Mixed Salt Desert Scrub	"In the interior west, salt desert shrublands are found in some of the driest of habitats, in basins, on rocky slopes, and plains.  The soils usually have a high percentage of salts or calcium, often because of the rocks from which the soil is derived, or because of the high rate of evaporation of water from the surface of the soil. These salt desert shrublands experience extreme climatic conditions, with warm to hot summers and freezing winters, with low amounts of rain or snow fall. The shrubs are adapted to these dry, ""saline"" conditions, often having spines, going dormant during extended dry periods, and having small leaves.  The most common shrubs are called ""saltbush"" species, and include shadscale, fourwing saltbush, cattle-spinach, spinescale, spiny hop-sage, or winter-fat.  They usally are low growing, and scattered, but sometimes can be dense. Grasses and herbs are also found, but because of the dry conditions are rarely abundant."
1	CONUS	486	486	03.B.1.D040M095E486	3403	Inter-Mountain Basins Wash	Barren washes in the intermountain west, restricted to seasonally or intermittently flooded streamsides.  These usually contain low cover of salt-desert shrubs such as black greasewood, spiny hopsage, rabbitbrush or rarely silver sagebrush.  While adjacent to stream channels, these semi-desert habitats are too dry to support typical lush stream-side vegetation, but are none-the-less shaped by seasonal floods, resulting in a narrow band of denser shrubs along the wash.
1	CONUS	487	487	03.B.1.D040M169E487	5305	Columbia Plateau Steppe and Grassland	Extensive grasslands occurring in basins, foothills and lower mountains in the northwestern US in sagebrush regions where sagebrush is absent or has low cover, usually because of past burning. These are grasslands composed of bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue or curly bluegrass, often with introduced annual cheatgrass present.  Other grasses may include Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush, streamside wild rye, needle-and-thread, and prairie junegrass.  Low cover of green rabbitbrush, rubber rabbitbrush, horsebrush or big sagebrush may be present, but these areas never have more than 5% cover of any shrubs.  The more frequent fires maintain the absence or low cover of shrubs over large areas.
1	CONUS	488	488	03.B.1.D040M169E488	5705	Great Basin Xeric Mixed Sagebrush Shrubland	Low growing sagebrush shrublands are found throughout the Great Basin, on dry flats and plains, alluvial fans, rolling hills, rocky hillslopes, saddles and ridges.  Usually they are found below the zone of pinyon-juniper woodlands.  These habitats are dry (xeric), often exposed to desiccating winds, and the soils are shallow, rocky, and not-salty.   Black sagebrush (mid and low elevations), Lahontan sagebrush, or alkali sagebrush (higher elevation) are the most common sages, but Wyoming big sagebrush is also common.  Rabbitbrush, shadscale, jointfir, goldenbush, spiny hop-sage, Shockley's desert-thorn, bud sagebrush, black greasewood, and horsebrush are some of the other shrubs.  Grasses and herbs are also found but are not very abundant because of the dry conditions.
1	CONUS	489	489	03.B.1.D040M169E489	5706	Inter-Mountain Basins Big Sagebrush Shrubland	Big sagebrush shrublands  are one of the most widespreadh ecological systems in the western US, found in broad basins between mountain ranges, on plains and in foothills between 1500 and 2300 m elevation. The soils are deep, well-drained and not salty.   The most important sages are wyoming or basin big sagebrush; other common shrubs include bitterbrush, rabbitbrush, or mountain snowberry.  Shrubs are the dominant vegetation, with grasses making up less than 25% of the cover, distinguishing this from the Intermountain Basins Big Sagebrush Steppe system, which has higher grass cover.  In recent years this systems has been ivaded by non-native annual grasses or weeds, in particular cheatgrass, which changes the patterns of fire.
1	CONUS	490	490	03.B.1.D040M169E490	5307	Inter-Mountain Basins Big Sagebrush Steppe	Open sagebrush steppe, which are habitats of mixed grassland with scattered shrubs, contain wyoming or basin big sagebrush, bitterbrush or other western sage-like shrubs with usually between 10% and 25% cover.  Native 'bunchgrasses' that form dense clumps at their base, along with other native grasses, tend to cover well over 25% of the ground, distinguishing this from Big Sagebrush Shrublands which are more shrubs and less grass.  With overgrazing and/or supression of natural wildfire, some sagebrush steppe can be converted to sagebrush shrublands. This is a very widespread type occurring on rolling and flat plains, with a variiety of soil condtions.  This type occurs throught the western U.S., and is dominant in the Columbia Plateau and the northwestern Great Plains of Wyoming and Montana.  Pronghorn antelope, sage grouse, pygmy rabbit, sage sparrow, and many plant and animal species utilze sagebrush steppe as their primary habitat.
1	CONUS	491	491	03.B.1.D040M169E491	5308	Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe	These are very widespread mountain sagebrush habitats always dominated by mountain big sagebrush, but with a lush grass and herb component. The overall appearance may be of a grasslands with scattered shrubs. These grassy shrublands (shrub-steppe) are found on mountain foothills and slopes, in areas ranging from deep soils to shallow stoney flats and ridgetops.  In general, this system shows an affinity for mild topography, fine soils, some source of moisture in the soil or more mesic sites, zones of higher precipitation and areas of snow accumulation. Other common shrubs include mountain silver sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, snowberry, serviceberry, rubber rabbitbrush, wild crabapple, wax currant, and green rabbitbrush.  Varied native bunchgrasses are almost always co-dominant. Higher in the mountains, they become very wildflower rich, and often occur in a matrix with montane and subalpine woodlands. In many areas, wildfires can maintain an open herbaceous-rich steppe condition.
1	CONUS	492	492	03.B.1.D040M170E492	5701	Colorado Plateau Mixed Low Sagebrush Shrubland	This ecological system occurs in the Colorado Plateau, Tavaputs Plateau and Uinta Basin in canyons, gravelly draws, hilltops, and dry flats at elevations generally below 1800 m. Soils are often rocky, shallow, and alkaline. In the southern Great Plains, this dry sagebrush system is found on limestone hills.  These are low sagebrush shrublands, where the dry conditions limit which species are found, and the abundance of plants.  Typically the cover of shrubs is low; black sagebrush or Bigelow's sagebrush, and sometimes Wyoming big sagebrush, are the most common shrubs.  Grasses adapted to semi-arid conditions are also found, such as Indian ricegrass, purple three-awn, blue grama, needle-and-thread, James' galleta, or muttongrass.
1	CONUS	493	493	03.B.1.D040M170E493	5306	Columbia Plateau Low Sagebrush Steppe	These low sagebrush shrublands and steppe (grasslands with scattered shrubs) are found on mountain ridges, terraces and gentile slopes in the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau.  Sites have poorly-drained, clay soils or very shallow, rocky soils. The only plants abundant on these poor soils are dwarf-shrubs such as dwarf sagebrush, alkali sagebrush, and black sagebrush.  Low cover of Wyoming big sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, buckwheat may also be present.  Native bunchgrasses, Idaho fescue, prairie junegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and curly bluegrass are common.  Occasional western juniper or curl-leaf mountain-mahogany may be present.

These dwarf-shrublands occur on poorly drained, very shallow soils on bedrock that are often saturated during winter then completely dry out by mid-summer.   Common species are either low to medium sized buckwheat shrubs or rigid sagebrush.  Grass and herb cover is low. Curly bluegrass is most common with scattered herbs such as onion, pussytoes, balsamroot, desertparsley, phlox, and stonecrop.  Annual plants may be seasonally abundant, and abundance of moss and lichen is often high in undisturbed areas.
1	CONUS	495	495	03.B.1.D040M170E495	5704	Wyoming Basins Dwarf Sagebrush Shrubland and Steppe	These very short sagebrush shrublands and shrub-steppe (grassland with scattered shrubs) occur in wind-scoured areas in the plains, on slopes near  mountains, and in high-elevation basins and plateaus in southern and central Wyoming.  These sites are cold and dry with shallow, often rocky soils. The dwarf shrubs are so short they may be hidden by grasses.  The common dwarf-shrubs are Wyoming three-tip sagebrush, alkali sagebrush, black sagebrush, and Wyoming big sagebrush, which may occur alone or in combinations. Grasses, cushion plants and other low growing herbs are common in shrub-steppe and some shrublands.

The grow on soils that are usually shallow but not salty, with lots of gravel or sand, over sandstone or limestone bedrock. They also sometimes grow in deeper soils on sandy plains where the shrubs invaded desert grasslands.  These often cover large areas, with an open shrubby appearance.  Blackbrush and Mormon-tea are most common, but Torrey's joint-fir, spiny hop-sage or sand sagebrush are also common. Herbs and grasses are not very abundant; common grasses include Indian ricegrass, James' galleta, or sand dropseed.
1	CONUS	497	497	03.B.1.D040M171E497	7305	Inter-Mountain Basins Semi-Desert Grassland	These are dry grasslands found on a variety of landforms, including swales, playas, mesas, alluvial flats, and plains. The soils are often sandy or loamy.  This systems is almost always dominanted by drought-resistant perennial bunchgrasses (growing in clumps), especially Indian ricegrass, threeawn, blue grama, needle-and-thread, muhly, or James' galleta. Scattered shrubs and dwarf-shrubs often are present, especially basin big sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, saltbush, blackbrush, jointfir, broom snakeweed, and winter-fat.  These grasslands typically integrade into salt-desert shrubs or sagebrush, and support grasslands due to unusual soils (sand, gravel or alluvium), and low rainfall.

It occurs on windswept mesas, broad basins and plains at low to moderate elevations (1300-1800 m).  Only a few species of shrubs can grow on the stabilized sandsheets or shallow to moderately deep sandy soils that may form small hummocks or small sand dunes. This semi-arid, open shrubland is typically dominated by short shrubs with little grass cover. Characteristic species include Cutler's jointfir, Torrey's joint-fir, Mormon-tea, and sand sagebrush. Blackbrush is typically not present. Hoary rosemarymint, common dunebroom, Tucker sand shinnery oak, or rubber rabbitbrush may also be present.  Wind-driven sand movement is visually present, with small ""blowouts"" or dunes, but these occur on a much smaller scale than in the Inter-Mountain Basins Active and Stabilized Dune system."

Strong wind, snow, and cloud-cover fog are prominent environmental factors, and many plants here have growth-forms specially adapted to these harsh conditions.  Most of the cover is matted dwarf shrubs, lichen, or sparse vegetation; islands of taller shrubs or shrub-form conifers  may occur in protected spots.  The dominant plants are dwarf heaths (bilberry is diagnostic and often dominant) and cushion-plants such as diapensia.  Bigelowâs sedge is a characteristic and, in some places, locally dominant herb.  This system includes wetland depressions, such as small alpine bogs, within the surrounding upland landscape.  Regionally rare species include the Katahdin arctic butterfly, northern bog lemming and rock vole.

It occurs in areas of level or concave topography, with late-lying snow and subirrigation from surrounding slopes. Soils have become stabilized in these sites, and often have lots of organic matter in them. These areas also have drying winds, frozen soils, and a short growing season. These alpine habitats are characterized by mountain heathers, herbs and tufts of alpine sedges and grasses.  Dwarf ""heath"" shrubs or dwarf willows less than 50 cm in height are dominant, including western moss heather, arctic willow, net-vein willow, rock willow, or pink mountain-heath.  Important herbs and grass-like plants include fleabane, partridgefoot, woolly pussytoes, tundra aster, lousewort, Indian paintbrush, tufted hairgrass, white marsh-marigold, fawnlily, Parry's rush, Piper's woodrush, northwestern showy sedge, black alpine sedge, and American bistort.

They occur on exposed saddles and ridgelines above upper treeline throughout the Rocky Mountains, including alpine areas of ranges in Utah and Nevada. Sites are dry with poor soils and only have low plant cover. Plants are low growing and mostly cushion or mat forming, frequently with traits to prevent water loss (succulent stems or leaves, flat to the ground in rosettes, or densely hairy). Common plants are mountain sandwort, Ross' avens, Pacific bog sedge, alpine stitchwort, Asian forget-me-not, Rocky Mountain nailwort, cushion phlox, creeping glow-wort, cushion pink, Uinta clover, and Parry's clover.
1	CONUS	503	503	04.B.1.D043M099E503	7103	Rocky Mountain Alpine Turf	Alpine turf occurs above upper treeline throughout the Rocky Mountains, including alpine areas in Utah and Nevada.  It is found on gentle to moderate slopes, flat ridges, and margins of alpine valleys, where the soil has become relatively stable.  These wind-swept sites  retain little snow cover and are relatively harsh, dry habitats. The plant cover is a short, often dense, diverse mixture of sod-forming grasses and sedges, and mat-forming herbs (cushion plants). Common plants include blackroot sedge, dry-spike sedge, scirpus-like sedge, arctic bluegrass, Ross' avens, Pacific bog sedge, cushion phlox, Parry's clover and Uinta clover.  Because of the very short growing season, summer flowers are often abundant.

1	CONUS	506	506	04.B.1.D043M101E506	5102	North Pacific Dry and Mesic Alpine Dwarf-Shrubland, Fell-field and Meadow	These are the truly alpine habitats found above treeline in the Pacific Northwest.  They are dominated by dwarf shrubs mountain heather, forbs, and sedges, and are covered by snow for most of the year, with only a few months of growing seasons. They are usually diverse mosaics of dwarf shrublands and windpruned shrubby  trees that are no more than 1-2 feet high, with extensive bare ground and late-lingering snowbanks.  It is a dry habitat because strong winter winds blow the snow away and expose the ground to cold temperatures and the constant, drying wind. Where snow collects, it acts as a blanket and keeps the ground warmer and protected from the wind.  This system represents those hearty plants that can survive winter without snow blanket protection.

Mudflats form a narrow band along oceanic inlets, and are more extensive at the mouths of larger rivers. Algae are the dominant plants on mudflats where little vascular vegetation is present due to the daily (in some cases twice daily) tidal flooding of salt or brackish water. Characteristic species include Vaucheria  and sea-lettuce.

Examples occur along large rivers where topography and alluvial processes have resulted in a well-developed floodplain.  A single occurrence may extend from river's edge across the outermost extent of the floodplain or to where it meets a wet meadow or upland system.  Many examples of this system will contain well-drained levees, terraces and stabilized bars, and some will include herbaceous sloughs and shrub wetlands resulting, in part, from beaver activity.  A variety of soil types may be found within the floodplain from very well-drained sandy substrates to very dense clays.  It is this variety of substrates in combination with different flooding regimes that creates the mix of vegetation.  Most areas, except for the montane alluvial forests, are inundated at some point each spring; microtopography determines how long the various habitats are inundated.  Although vegetation is quite variable in this broadly defined system, examples may include Acer saccharinum, Platanus occidentalis, Liquidambar styraciflua, and Quercus spp.  Understory species are mixed, but include shrubs, such as Cephalanthus occidentalis and Arundinaria gigantea ssp. gigantea, and sedges (Carex spp.).  This system likely floods at least once annually and can be altered by occasional severe floods.  Impoundments and conversion to agriculture can also impact this system.

Variation:  Herbaceous - Herbaceous sloughs and shrub wetlands (canebrakes, sedges, and buttonbush) that occur within the floodplain.

Other Variation(s):  Forested."

Examples may be found along large rivers of the East and Upper East Gulf Coastal Plain, especially the Apalachicola, Alabama, Tombigbee, Pascagoula, and Pearl rivers, all of which ultimately drain into the Gulf of Mexico.  Several distinct plant communities can be recognized within this system that may be related to the array of different geomorphologic features present within the floodplain.  Some of the major geomorphic features associated with different community types include natural levees, point bars, meander scrolls, oxbows, and sloughs (Sharitz and Mitsch 1993).  Vegetation generally includes forests dominated by bottomland hardwood species and other trees tolerant of flooding.  However, herbaceous and shrub vegetation may be present in certain areas as well.

1	CONUS	513	513	05.B.1.D049M109E513	9225	Temperate Pacific Freshwater Aquatic Bed	Freshwater aquatic beds are found throughout the humid temperate regions of the Pacific Coast of North America. They are small patch in size, confined to lakes, ponds, and slow-moving portions of rivers and streams. In large bodies of water, they are usually restricted to the deep water where lack of light penetration through the water limits plant growth. A variety of rooted or floating aquatic herbaceous species may dominate, including mosquito fern, yellow pond-lily, knotweed, pondweed, buttercup, and watermeal. Submerged vegetation, such as watermilfoil, hornwort, and waterweed, is often present. These communities occur in water too deep for emergent (e.g. cattails and bullrushes) vegetation.

Serpentinite outcrops can support distinct vegetation, as these soils can have very low Calcium to Magnesium ratios that  impact the ability of plants to grow. This system is usually found on steep slopes with loosely consolidated soils and harsh soil chemical conditions (large rock outcrops and gravelly soil). There is typically a very low cover (<10%) of herbaceous species, including twistflower spp., dwarf-flax spp., scythe-leaf onion, Cascade onion, serpentine milkweed, Bear Valley wild buckwheat, and naked wild buckwheat.

This system also includes unstable scree and talus slopes typically occurring below cliff faces. Scattered vegetation may include shrub species from surrounding coastal chaparral, such as bigpod ceanothus, chaparral whitethorn, smooth mountain-mahogany, bigberry manzanita, and mission manzanita. Soil development is limited as is herbaceous cover.
1	CONUS	517	517	06.B.2.D051M111E517	3206	Central Interior Acidic Cliff and Talus	These acidic cliff and talus outcrops are found primarily in the Interior Highlands of the United States, from central Kentucky and southern Indiana to the Ozarks of  Missouri and Arkansas.  They extend along the Mississippi River and Missouri  River north to southern Iowa and west to northwestern Missouri.  They occur where acidic bedrock reaches the surface and forms cliffs or talus fields.  They tend to be fairly small (dozens to a few hundred acres).  Sites can range from moist to dry.  They are typically sparsely vegetated; however, on moister sites with more soil development several fern species and sedges can establish. Wind and water erosion are the major dynamic processes influencing this system.
1	CONUS	518	518	06.B.2.D051M111E518	3205	Central Interior Calcareous Cliff and Talus	This system is found primarily west of the Appalachians in the Midwest and south into Tennessee and Arkansas.  Limestone and dolomite outcrops and talus distinguish this system.  Examples tend to be relatively small because they are restricted to where bedrock reaches the surface.  Sites range from moist to dry and from sparsely to moderately well-vegetated. Woodland species such as northern white cedar can establish along the ridgetops. Rocky grassy openings are typical and can contain species little bluestem, big bluestem, and a variety of wildflowers. Wind and water erosion along with fire are the primary natural dynamics.
1	CONUS	519	519	06.B.2.D051M111E519	3302	East Gulf Coastal Plain Dry Chalk Bluff	The system is endemic to the Black Belt region of Alabama and Mississippi.

1	CONUS	520	520	06.B.2.D051M111E520	3208	North-Central Appalachian Acidic Cliff and Talus	These sparsely vegetated to partially wooded rocky outcrops in the Central Appalachians occur at low to mid elevations from central New England south to Virginia, and up to 4500â in West Virginia. The system consists of vertical or near-vertical cliffs and the talus slopes below, formed on hills of granitic, sandstone, or otherwise acidic bedrock. In some cases, especially in areas near the glacial boundary, this system may take the form of upper-slope boulderfields without adjacent cliffs, where talus forms from freeze/thaw action on the bedrock. Most of the substrate is dry and exposed, but small (or occasionally large) areas of seepage are often present.. The vegetation is patchy and often sparse, punctuated with patches of small trees.  Red-cedar is a characteristic tree species, poison ivy is a characteristic woody vine, and rock polypody is a characteristic fern.  Within its range (Pennsylvania and New Jersey south), Virginia pine is often present.
1	CONUS	521	521	06.B.2.D051M111E521	3207	North-Central Appalachian Circumneutral Cliff and Talus	This rocky outcrop system occurs at low to mid elevations from central New England south to Virginia and West Virginia. It consists of vertical or near-vertical cliffs and steep talus slopes where weathering and/or higher pH-bedrock produce near-neutral to calcareous pH and enriched nutrient availability. Rock types include limestone, dolomite and others. The vegetation varies from sparse to patches of small trees, in places forming woodland or even forest vegetation. American basswood, ash, and American bladdernut are woody indicators of the enriched setting; northern white cedar is sometimes present. The herb layer is typically not extensive but includes at least some species that are indicators of enriched conditions, such as yellow jewelweed, purple cliffbrake, ebony spleenwort, or common cliff fern.
1	CONUS	522	522	06.B.2.D051M111E522	3220	Southern Appalachian Montane Cliff	This small-patch system consists of steep to vertical or overhanging rock outcrops (and related steep talus slopes) of the Southern Blue Ridge and adjacent areas (in the northeast, Virginia only). It occurs on lower slopes, usually in river gorges or bluffs. The sparse vegetation is limited to plants growing on bare rock, small ledges, and crevices. Vegetation is primarily bryophytes, lichens, and herbs, with sparse trees and shrubs rooted in deeper soil pockets and crevices.
1	CONUS	523	523	06.B.2.D051M111E523	3219	Southern Interior Acid Cliff	This small-patch system encompasses calcareous cliffs of the Southern Ridge and Valley and adjacent Cumberland Plateau (in the northeast, southern Virginia only). It includes vertical to near-vertical rock faces of limestone and dolomite. These cliffs are typically dry but may contain relatively small embedded seepage patches. Due to harsh edaphic conditions, including verticality, these cliffs are nearly unvegetated, however, spleenwort and cliffbrake ferns may be characteristic plants. Some cliffs have scattered northern white cedar trees which may be very old (>800 years). This system also covers a narrow zone of vegetation, often herbaceous, at the horizontal clifftop where growing conditions are harsh and often gladelike.
1	CONUS	524	524	06.B.2.D051M111E524	3221	Southern Interior Calcareous Cliff	This sandhill seep system occurs in small patches on slopes in dissected terrain, where a clay lens or other impermeable layer forces groundwater to the surface as seepage. This type occurs largely in the Fall-line Sandhills region of the Carolinas and Georgia but also rarely in other parts of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Soils are seasonally to permanently saturated by seepage and range from sandy or clayey to mucky. Vegetation is variable and complex in composition and structure, consisting of a mixture of plants of pine savannas and streamhead pocosins, but contrasting with both in structure and proportions. The tree canopy may be open or absent, and patches of dense shrubs, dense grass, ferns, and various mixtures may be present. Fire is a crucial determinant of structure and composition; it tends to occur in a variable and patchy pattern that is driven by both the fire regime of the surrounding system and the wetness of the seep vegetation at the time.

They occur on lower to mid slopes, usually in river gorges or bluffs. The sparse vegetation is limited to plants growing on bare rock, small ledges, and crevices. Vegetation is primarily bryophytes, lichens, and herbs, with sparse trees and shrubs rooted in deeper soil pockets and crevices.
1	CONUS	526	526	06.B.2.D051M132E526	3602	Southern Appalachian Granitic Dome	This system consists of smooth, curved, exfoliated outcrops of massive granitic rocks in the Southern Blue Ridge and adjacent upper Piedmont. Smooth rock without crevices is the primary distinctive ecological factor of this system. The surface is largely bare rock but has thin soil mats around the edges and in other patches. Resulting vegetation is a complex of small patches of different species and structure on soil mats of different depths, ranging from moss and lichens to herbs to shrubs and trees.
1	CONUS	527	527	06.B.2.D051M132E527	3506	Southern Appalachian Rocky Summit	This system represents treeless rock outcrops of the southern Appalachian Mountains, primarily in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. Outcrops may be vertical to horizontal, rugged or fractured rock outcrops of peaks, ridgetops, upper slopes, and other topographically exposed locations (Schafale and Weakley 1990). Higher elevation examples occur from 1200 to 2030 m in elevation; other examples may be found at elevations of 305 m (1000 feet) or lower on foothills. These outcrops occur on felsic to mafic rocks and are distinguished from surrounding systems by the prevalence of bare or lichen-encrusted rocks. The vegetation component of this system is generally characterized by a mixture of low-growing lifeforms, especially lichens, mosses, and short-statured forbs. Less commonly, graminoids and low shrubs are encountered. Species common to all outcrop vegetation types include wretched sedge, cliff saxifrage, and highbush blueberry (Wiser and White 1999).
1	CONUS	528	528	06.B.2.D051M132E528	3606	Southern Piedmont Granite Flatrock	This small-patch system consists of smooth, exfoliated outcrops of massive granite and related rocks in the Piedmont from Virginia southward. Elevations in Virginia range from 230â-320â, with most occurring near streams where erosion has left smooth rock and small gravelly depressions. The vegetation is a complex of different species and structure occupying different microhabitats, ranging from moss and lichens to herbs to shrubs and a few trees. In some areas, these microhabitats include solution pits or depressions that retain water and form a distinctive wetland community.
1	CONUS	529	529	06.B.2.D052M113E529	3202	Rocky Mountain Cliff, Canyon and Massive Bedrock	These are cliffs, canyons and large bedrock outcrops found throughout the Rocky Mountains.  The are generally barren, rocky systems with more rock than vegetation, although as seen from above, many can be quite narrow.  They include the steep cliffs, and unstable scree and talus slopes often found below the cliffs.  There may be small patches of dense vegetation, but it typically includes scattered trees and/or shrubs. Characteristic trees includes species from the surrounding landscape, such as Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, limber pine, quaking aspen, white fir, subalpine fir, or two-needle pinyon and juniper at lower elevations. There may be scattered shrubs present, such as species of oceanspray, currant, ninebark, rose, juniper, five-petal cliffbush, creeping Oregon-grape, skunkbush, or Saskatoon serviceberry. Soil development is limited, as is herbaceous cover.

Vegetative cover is dominated by wildflowers, grasses, mosses, or lichens. This also includes unstable scree and talus slopes typically occurring below cliff faces. Scattered vegetation may include Douglas-fir and bigleaf maple along with herbaceous and nonvascular species such as Lemmon's needlegrass, western needlegrass, bottlebrush, cream stonecrop, and Racomitrium moss. Soil development is limited as is herbaceous cover.
1	CONUS	531	531	06.B.2.D052M114E531	3209	North Pacific Montane Massive Bedrock, Cliff and Talus	This ecological system is found from foothill to subalpine elevations and includes barren and sparsely vegetated landscapes (generally <10% plant cover) of steep cliff faces, narrow canyons, and larger rock outcrops of various igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic bedrock types. Also included are unstable scree and talus that typically occur below cliff faces. The dominant process is drought and other extreme growing conditions created by exposed rock or unstable slopes typically associated with steep slopes. Fractures in the rock surface and less steep or more stable slopes may be occupied by small patches of dense vegetation, typically scattered trees and/or shrubs. Characteristic trees includes Alaska yellow-cedar, hemlock spp., western red-cedar, Douglas-fir, or fir spp. There may be scattered shrubs present, such as vine maple, alder spp., and currant spp.  Mosses or lichens may be very dense, well-developed and display cover well over 10%.

They support open stands of trees, with Douglas-fir, Ponderosa pine or western white pine important at low elevation sites, and lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, subalpine fir and mountain hemlock important at higher elevation sites.  Grasses, wildflowers (with the characteristic serpentine indicator lacefern or indian's dream usually present), and shrubs can be part of a varied understory.
1	CONUS	533	533	06.B.2.D052M114E533	3604	North Pacific Volcanic Rock and Cinder Land	This system is for the barren and sparsely vegetated volcanic lava flows, cinders, ash beds and volcanic boulder fields created by the active volcanos occuring throughout the Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest.  These are not vegetated, or have vegetation limited to a few small openings.  Due to the active nature of many of the northwest volcanos, these range from small patches around older volcanos, like Mount Jefferson, and large barren areas around active volcanos such as Mt. St. Helens.

Common trees include scattered California red fir, Douglas-fir, Sierran lodgepole pine, Jeffrey pine, or in foothills, singleleaf pinyon, Utah juniper, and curl-leaf mountain-mahogany.  Manzanita or ceanothus shrubs are frequently present.
1	CONUS	535	535	06.B.2.D053M115E535	3301	Western Great Plains Badland	The Western Great Plains Badlands occur within the northern Great Plains region of the United States and Canada with some of the better known and extensive examples in North and South Dakota. In contrast to Western Great Plains Cliff and Outcrop System, this system is typified by extremely dry and easily eroded, consolidated clay soils with bands of sandstone or isolated consolidates and little to no cover of vegetation (usually less than 10% but can be as high as 20%). In those areas with vegetation, plants can include scattered individuals of many dryland shrubs or herbaceous species.This system can occur where the land lies well above its local base level or below and is created by several factors, including elevation, rainfall, carving action of streams, and parent material.  This system contains highly erodible soils that can be strongly influenced by infrequent, but often torrential, rains.
1	CONUS	536	536	06.B.2.D053M116E536	3217	Southwestern Great Plains Canyon	This ecological system occurs in both perennial and intermittent stream canyons of the southwestern Great Plains. Soils can range from deep loams to alluvial to sandy. The mosaic of soil types which have developed from sandstone, limestone, basalt, and shale parent materials creates a complex mosaic of grasslands, shrublands and woodlands within the canyon system.  The varied geology, diverse soil types, and topographic dynamics together form a distinct ecological system characteristic of the canyons and dissected mesas of the southwestern Great Plains. Vegetation varies both regionally and locally depending on latitude, aspect, slope position and substrate and can range from riparian vegetation to xeric or mesic woodlands and shrublands.  Because of the varied topography, relatively permanent water along streambeds and southern location, these canyonlands have a rich herpetofauna. This system provides good habitat for a number of snake species that are otherwise uncommon in this region. Occasional seeps and springs of the canyon walls provide habitat for rare ferns.
1	CONUS	537	537	06.B.2.D053M116E537	3203	Western Great Plains Cliff and Outcrop	This system includes cliffs and outcrops throughout the western Great Plains. Substrate can range from sandstone and limestone, which can often form bands in the examples of this system. Vegetation is restricted to shelves, cracks and crevices in the rock. However, this system differs from Western Great Plains Badlands System in that often the soil is slightly developed and less erodible, and some grass and shrub species can occur at greater than 10%. Common species in this system include short shrubs such as skunkbush and longleaf wormwood and mixedgrass species such as sideoats grama, blue grama, and prairie sandreed. Drought and wind erosion are the most common natural dynamics affecting this system.

1	CONUS	545	545	06.C.2.D055M118E545	3121	Inter-Mountain Basins Active and Stabilized Dune	The system is defined by the presence of migrating dunes, or if they have become stabilized, they are likely to become actively migrating again with disturbance or increased aridity. In the Colorado Plateau, there are many small active and partially vegetated dunes along some of the larger washes and playas (where sand is blown out of wash and forms dunes) and some larger dunes such as Coral Pink Dunes in southwestern Utah. The soils are usually windblown sand, but small dunes composed of silt and clay downwind from playas are also found. Plants occupying these environments are often adapted to shifting, coarse-textured substrates (usually quartz sand) and form patchy or open grasslands, shrublands or steppe (grass and shrub mix), and occasionally woodlands. The mix of species varies and may be composed of sagebrush, saltbush, rabbitbrush, blackbrush, Indian rice-grass, needle-and-thread grass, sand lyme grass, or sandhills muhly.

It also includes shale slopes interbedded with sandstone outcrops.  The vegetation is very sparse at best, and consists of scattered dwarf-shrubs (especially Gardner saltbush, sometimes birdsfoot sage) or shrubs (shadscale saltbush, Wyoming big sagebrush, greasewood, Douglas rabbitbrush) and grasses (especially western wheatgrass and Sandberg bluegrass).  Badlands are subject to erosion, and gullying, often forming colorful, fantastic landscapes."

2	Alaska	1	601	01.C.2.D009M024E601	2650	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Periglacial Woodland and Shrubland	This ecological system occurs as an early-successional sere on landscapes recently exposed through deglaciation since the end of the Little Ice Age (especially common in Glacier Bay and Kenai Fjords). This is not a riverine system, and glacial outwash systems are also not included. Soils are derived from glacial till, residuum and colluvium and are shallow, stony, and well-drained to excessively well-drained. Soil profile development is lacking or minimal. Early-seral stages of forested systems with low cover of Picea sitchensis and Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa occur on older landscapes at low elevations near the maximum glacial extent. Depending on time since ice has receded, some sites may have woodlands of either Populus balsamifera or a mix of Populus balsamifera and Picea sitchensis. On other sites Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata often dominates the species composition, although Salix sitchensis, Salix alaxensis, or Salix barclayi may also be abundant. Salix spp. and Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata are commonly mixed with the trees on wooded sites as well. Rubus spectabilis is uncommon in this system. Common herbaceous species include Calamagrostis canadensis, Chamerion angustifolium, Chamerion latifolium, Heracleum maximum, Lupinus nootkatensis, Equisetum arvense, Athyrium filix-femina, Dryopteris expansa, Phegopteris connectilis, Streptopus amplexifolius, Pyrola spp., Carex mertensii, and Epilobium spp. Mosses and lichens may be abundant on some sites; common early-seral nonvascular species include Racomitrium canescens, Pohlia nutans, Drepanocladus aduncus, Stereocaulon tomentosum, Cladonia crispata, and Cladina portentosa.
2	Alaska	2	602	01.C.2.D009M024E602	2654	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Sitka Spruce Beach Ridge	This ecological system includes productive forests on beach ridges and occurs along the Alaska Gulf Coast in the following areas: Copper River Delta, Cape Yakataga, Yakutat Forelands, and outer coast of Glacier Bay National Park. Picea sitchensis is usually dominant in the canopy, but Tsuga heterophylla can be codominant especially on older sites. Oplopanax horridus is usually the most abundant understory shrub; other common shrubs include Vaccinium ovalifolium and Rubus spectabilis. Understory species include Circaea alpina, Rubus pedatus, Streptopus amplexifolius, Tiarella trifoliata, Athyrium filix-femina, Dryopteris expansa, and Gymnocarpium dryopteris. Mature forests usually have very little downed wood or snags. Beach ridges form and become removed from direct contact with saltwater through long shore sediment transport coupled with isostatic rebound (Shephard 1993). Coastal beach communities are often dominated by Leymus mollis and brackish meadows. Picea sitchensis seedlings establish in the brackish meadows, but often do not survive, probably due to excessive salt spray. Further inland, Picea sitchensis seedlings establish and survive in these meadows, and the meadow transitions to forest. Picea sitchensis establishes about 130 years after beach ridge formation and may succeed to Tsuga heterophylla forest.
2	Alaska	3	603	01.C.2.D009M024E603	2644	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Sitka Spruce Forest	This productive ecological system occurs on well-drained sideslopes and footslopes along the Gulf Coast of Alaska and the North Pacific, in the perhumid and subpolar rainforest zones. Sites dominated by Picea sitchensis are usually tied to disturbance such as slope instability, water movement (either downhill through the soil or in open streams), exposure to salt spray, or windthrow. Picea sitchensis is the dominant tree species, although Tsuga mertensiana or Tsuga heterophylla may be minor canopy associates. In southeastern Alaska, Alnus rubra may be an associated understory tree species, especially in upland alluvial fans. Common species in the shrub layer include Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata, Oplopanax horridus, Rubus spectabilis, and Vaccinium ovalifolium. Common herbaceous species include Maianthemum dilatatum, Tiarella trifoliata, Dryopteris expansa, and Gymnocarpium dryopteris. Calamagrostis nutkaensis may be common on exposed sites near the coast. In the northern portion of the temperate rainforest (Kodiak Island, Kenai Fjords, and Prince William Sound), Picea sitchensis is frequently the dominant canopy tree from sea level to treeline on productive sites, and it is the only conifer that occurs on Afognak and Kodiak islands, where its range is actively expanding. In the southern portion of the Alaskan rainforest, Picea sitchensis is linked more closely with disturbance (e.g., very steep sites, recently deglaciated landscapes, outer coast headlands, upland alluvial fans, ancient landslides) and karst substrates. It also occurs commonly at upper elevations just below the mountain hemlock zone.
2	Alaska	4	604	01.C.2.D009M024E604	2646	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Western Hemlock Forest	This forested ecological system is the dominant Tsuga heterophylla forest system along the northern portions of the Pacific Northwest Coast. It occurs from coastal British Columbia (north of the northern limit of Pseudotsuga menziesii) through southeast Alaska to Prince William Sound (the northwest limit of Tsuga heterophylla). This system ranges from sea level to about 610 m (0-2000 feet) elevation. The climate is wet with heavy snow and rainfall, but sites occupied are typically well-drained. The dominant upper canopy species is Tsuga heterophylla or a mix of Picea sitchensis and Tsuga heterophylla. In the northern portion of the region (Yakutat through Prince William Sound), Tsuga mertensiana may also be present in the canopy. Chamaecyparis nootkatensis may be present in the canopy in southeastern Alaska (Glacier Bay to British Columbia?) but is rare in this system in Prince William Sound (the northwestern limit of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis). The shrub layer is often dominated by Vaccinium ovalifolium, with Menziesia ferruginea usually present; Rubus spectabilis and Oplopanax horridus are also common. Lysichiton americanus occurs in poorly drained depressions. Other common forbs include Rubus pedatus, Streptopus amplexifolius, Cornus canadensis, and Tiarella trifoliata. Dryopteris expansa is common in well-drained, relatively nutrient-rich sites. Other common ferns include Gymnocarpium dryopteris, Blechnum spicant, and Dryopteris expansa. Disturbed sites, such as V-notches, can have abundant Rubus spectabilis or Oplopanax horridus dominating the undergrowth. Sites may receive very infrequent catastrophic disturbance leading to large older trees and multiple canopy layers where western hemlock regeneration is favored. Diseases including dwarf mistletoe and heart rot fungi perpetuate the hemlock-dominated old-growth condition. On other sites, wind disturbance yields forests approaching an even-aged condition dominated by Tsuga heterophylla but with a component of Picea sitchensis.
2	Alaska	5	605	01.C.2.D009M024E605	2178	North Pacific Hypermaritime Western Red-cedar-Western Hemlock Forest	These forests occupy the outer coastal portions of British Columbia, southeastern Alaska, and northwestern Washington. Their center of distribution is the northern coast of British Columbia, as Thuja plicata approaches its northernmost limit in the southern half of southeastern Alaska. These forests occur mainly on islands but also fringe the mainland. They are never more than 25 km from saltwater; elevation ranges from 0 to 600 m, and below 245 m in Alaska (above 200 m, Chamaecyparis nootkatensis replaces Thuja plicata). The climate is hypermaritime, with cool summers, very wet winters, abundant fog, and without a major snowpack . Fire is absent from this system in Alaska and rare throughout the rest of the range. These forests are more influenced by gap disturbance processes and intense windstorms than by fire. The terrain is mostly gentle to rolling, of low topographic relief, and often rocky. Soils typically have a distinct humus layer overlying mineral horizons or bedrock; where the system is best developed in central British Columbia, the humus layers are very thick (mean 17-35 cm). Soils are often imperfectly drained, but this is not a wetland system. Thuja plicata and Tsuga heterophylla are the dominant tree species throughout, and Chamaecyparis nootkatensis joins them from northern Vancouver Island north. Canopy cover of trees is typically over 60%. Pinus contorta and Tsuga mertensiana can be present in some locations in the central and northern portion of the range. Abies amabilis occurs in British Columbia and northern Washington stands but is not typically found in southeastern Alaska. In Washington, nearly pure stands of Tsuga heterophylla are common and seem to be associated with microsites most exposed to intense windstorms. A shrub layer of Gaultheria shallon, Vaccinium ovalifolium, and Menziesia ferruginea is usually well-developed. The fern Blechnum spicant in great abundance is typical of hypermaritime conditions. Oxalis oregana (absent in Alaska) is important in the understory of moist sites in Washington. Polystichum munitum occurs at the northern end of its range in southeastern Alaska on well-drained sites. The abundance of Thuja plicata in relation to other conifers is one of the diagnostic characters of these forests; the other is the low abundance of Pseudotsuga menziesii (absent in Alaska) and Picea sitchensis. Where these forests are best developed, they occur in a mosaic with forested wetlands, bogs, and Sitka spruce forests (the latter in riparian areas and on steep, more productive soils).
2	Alaska	6	606	01.C.2.D009M024E606	2040	North Pacific Mesic Western Hemlock-Yellow-cedar Forest	This system occurs throughout southeastern Alaska but appears to be more common in central southeastern Alaska. It is more common on the islands than on the mainland and is less common on northern Chichagof Island than on southern Chichagof and Baranof islands. It occurs at all elevations below the Mountain Hemlock Zone and is most abundant on somewhat poorly to moderately drained slopes. In the southern part of southeastern Alaska, this system generally occupies the upper edge of the Western Hemlock Zone, from 305-610 m (1000-2000 feet) elevation. On non-alluvial low-elevation sites, Chamaecyparis nootkatensis abundance increases as soil drainage becomes poorer. Poor drainage results in fewer trees and, therefore, more understory light, allowing yellow-cedar to survive and reproduce despite competition from western hemlock. Chamaecyparis nootkatensis is more tolerant of poor soil drainage than Tsuga heterophylla. Chamaecyparis nootkatensis is a codominant with Tsuga heterophylla in stands with moderately open (50-70%) canopies. Yellow-cedar cover typically ranges from 5-50% and rarely dominates the overstory. Picea sitchensis may be an overstory component. The canopy is typically multilayered, with Tsuga heterophylla dominating the lower layers. This system intergrades with Tsuga mertensiana forests, and Tsuga mertensiana may occur in transitional stands. The shrub layer is relatively well-developed (>50%) in late-seral stands and includes Vaccinium ovalifolium and Menziesia ferruginea, with Lysichiton americanus and Coptis spp. as consistently present herbaceous species. Blechnum spicant is the most common fern, while Dryopteris expansa is nearly absent from this type. This system is distinguished by the codominance of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis and Tsuga heterophylla and the absence or rarity of Thuja plicata, Picea sitchensis, and Abies amabilis.
2	Alaska	7	607	01.C.2.D009M025E607	2678	Alaska Sub-boreal Mountain Hemlock-White Spruce Forest	This ecological system occurs on sideslopes and rolling terrain on the inland side of the Kenai and Chugach mountains and represents a transition from maritime forests to south-central boreal forests. Soils are mesic and derived from colluvium, glacial deposits, or residual bedrock. Permafrost is rare. Picea X lutzii is the dominant spruce and Tsuga mertensiana is codominant in the canopy and has at least 15% cover. The major disturbance processes include fungal pathogens, human disturbance, fire, blowdown, and insect infestations.
2	Alaska	8	608	01.C.2.D009M025E608	2648	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Mountain Hemlock Forest	This ecological system occurs along the Gulf of Alaska Coast and Pacific Coast from Kenai Fjords through southeastern Alaska. It occurs primarily in the maritime region, but also occurs in the sub-boreal transition on the inland side of the Kenai and Chugach mountains. This system occurs on relatively stable sideslopes and benches, and soils are generally well-drained. The lower and upper elevational limits of this system decrease from south to north and from east to west. The climate is generally characterized by short, cool summers, rainy autumns and long, cool, wet winters with heavy snow cover for 5-9 months. Fire is very rare in the sub-boreal portion of the distribution and absent from the rest of the range. Tsuga mertensiana is the dominant conifer with at least 15% cover, but associated canopy trees vary by region. In the northern portion of its range (from Kenai Fjords to Yakutat), the system occurs from sea level to upper forest elevations.. Picea sitchensis or Tsuga heterophylla may be codominant. In the sub-boreal region, Picea X lutzii may be present in the canopy, but cover is less than 15%. In southeast Alaska, this system is the predominant forest of upper elevations. It occurs above the western hemlock, western hemlock - red-cedar, and western hemlock - yellow-cedar systems and below the subalpine mountain memlock dwarf-tree system. Elevations generally range from 300 to 1000 m. Tsuga mertensiana is the dominant tree species. Picea sitchensis, Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (northern limit is Prince William Sound), or Tsuga heterophylla may be present but are less abundant than Tsuga mertensiana. Throughout the entire range of the system, the dominant understory shrub is typically Vaccinium ovalifolium; other common shrubs include Menziesia ferruginea, Elliottia pyroliflorus, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Empetrum nigrum. Common herbaceous species include Rubus pedatus, Cornus canadensis, Gymnocarpium dryopteris, Blechnum spicant, and Listera cordata. Major disturbance processes include avalanche, fungal pathogens, and blowdown. Parklands (open woodlands or sparse trees with dwarf-shrub or herbaceous vegetation) are not part of this system but of North Pacific Maritime Mesic Subalpine Parkland (CES204.837) or Alaskan Pacific Maritime Subalpine Mountain Hemlock Woodland (CES204.143).
2	Alaska	9	609	01.C.2.D009M025E609	2649	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Subalpine Mountain Hemlock Woodland	This subalpine ecological system occurs in the upper slopes of mountain ranges along the Gulf Coast of Alaska, including the Kenai, Chugach, St. Elias, Fairweather, and Coast mountains. It is dominated by mountain hemlock forests and parkland growing near elevational treeline. Tsuga mertensiana is the dominant tree and often grows with a stunted growth form (krummholz). Patches of forest interspersed with alpine heath or tall shrub characterize this system. Treeline forests often grow as small patches at the lower elevation of alpine tundra and forb meadow systems. Common understory species include Phyllodoce aleutica (or Phyllodoce glanduliflora), Harrimanella stelleriana, Luetkea pectinata, Empetrum nigrum, Nephrophyllidium crista-galli, and Geum calthifolium. The major disturbance processes include avalanche, fungal pathogens, and blowdown.
2	Alaska	10	610	01.C.2.D009M025E610	2038	North Pacific Maritime Mesic Subalpine Parkland	This ecological system occurs throughout the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, from the southern Cascades of Oregon to the mountains of southeastern Alaska bordering British Columbia. It occurs at the transition zone of forest to alpine, forming a subalpine forest-meadow ecotone. Mountain hemlock forests, as they approach treeline, become open patches of mature-height trees surrounded by mesic and wet meadows rich in dwarf-shrubs and forbs. Clumps of trees to small patches of forest interspersed with low shrublands and meadows characterize this system. Krummholz often occurs near the upper elevational limit of this system where it grades into alpine vegetation. Associations include woodlands, forested, and subalpine meadow types. It occurs on the west side of the Cascade Mountains and is a transitional open forest into the true alpine on the interior side of the Coastal Mountains of British Columbia where deep, late-lying snowpack is the primary environmental factor. Major tree species are Tsuga mertensiana, Abies amabilis, Chamaecyparis nootkatensis, and Abies lasiocarpa. This system includes British Columbia Hypermaritime and Maritime Parkland (Tsuga mertensiana). Dominant dwarf-shrubs include Phyllodoce empetriformis, Cassiope mertensiana, and Vaccinium deliciosum. Dominant herbaceous species include Lupinus arcticus ssp. subalpinus, Valeriana sitchensis, Carex spectabilis, and Polygonum bistortoides. There is very little disturbance, either windthrow or fire. The major process controlling vegetation is the very deep long-lasting snowpacks (deepest in the North Pacific region) limiting tree regeneration. Trees get established only in favorable microsites (mostly adjacent to existing trees) or during drought years with low snowpack. It is distinguished from more interior dry parkland primarily by the presence of Tsuga mertensiana or Abies amabilis and absence or paucity of Pinus albicaulis and Larix lyallii.
2	Alaska	11	611	01.C.3.D012M035E611	2655	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Floodplain Forest and Shrubland	This system includes glacially- and non-glacially-fed rivers and streams along the Gulf Coast of Alaska. It includes the active and inactive portions of the floodplain but not abandoned floodplains. Frequent flooding, shifting channels, and sediment deposition characterize the system. This system includes large and small channels as well as proximal outwash. Glacially-fed rivers occur primarily on the mainland, while non-glacially-fed rivers occur on both the mainland and large islands in the Gulf of Alaska. Since glacial and non-glacial floodplain types can not be mapped confidently as separate systems, they are considered one ecological system. However, vegetation composition and disturbance cycle vary depending on type of input (glacial vs. non-glacial) and proximity to the glacier, so descriptions that follow retain these distinctions. Two floodplain types are described below: glacial floodplains and non-glacial floodplains. (It may be possible to apply different successional models by region or proximity to glacier terminus.)
2	Alaska	12	612	01.C.3.D012M035E612	2681	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Poorly Drained Conifer Woodland	This ecological system occurs on low to mid elevations on rolling terrain, benches, and gentle slopes with restricted drainage from Kenai Fjords through southeast Alaska. Soils may be shallow to deep, are poorly drained, and usually have a thick organic layer or some peat development. In some places, stands are often a fine mosaic of peatlands and better-drained inclusions. These are low-productivity sites that are intermediate between shore pine or mountain hemlock peatland sites and productive forest systems. The forest canopy is open (less than 45% cover), and trees often show signs of stress such as spike-top (especially cedar) or chlorotic foliage (especially spruce). Standing dead trees are common. In the north, paludification on these sites may lead to conversion from mountain hemlock to mountain hemlock peatland over long time scales. Overstory trees may include several of the following species: Tsuga heterophylla, Tsuga mertensiana (often alone or with Picea sitchensis in the subpolar rainforest zone), Thuja plicata (southern portion of the Alaska distribution only), and Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (= Cupressus nootkatensis). Picea sitchensis and Pinus contorta may also be present but are not dominant. Common shrubs include Vaccinium ovalifolium, Gaultheria shallon (southern portion of the Alaska distribution only), and Elliottia pyroliflorus. Common understory species include Nephrophyllidium crista-galli, Thelypteris quelpaertensis, Phegopteris connectilis, Trichophorum caespitosum, Carex anthoxanthea, Carex pluriflora, Carex stylosa, Eriophorum spp., Lysichiton americanus, and Sphagnum spp.
2	Alaska	13	613	01.C.3.D012M035E613	2663	North Pacific Shrub Swamp	Swamps vegetated by shrublands occur throughout the Pacific Northwest Coast, from Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound, Alaska, to the southern coast of Oregon. These are deciduous broadleaf tall shrublands that are located in depressions, around lakes or ponds, or river terraces where water tables fluctuate seasonally (mostly seasonally flooded regime), in areas that receive nutrient-rich waters. These depressions are poorly drained with fine-textured organic, muck or mineral soils and standing water common throughout the growing season. Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata often dominates the shrub layer, but many Salix species may also occur. The shrub layer can have many dead stems. However, various species of Salix, Spiraea douglasii, Malus fusca, Cornus sericea, Alnus incana ssp. tenuifolia (= Alnus tenuifolia), Alnus viridis ssp. crispa (= Alnus crispa), and/or Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata (= Alnus sinuata) can be the major dominants. They may occur in mosaics with marshes or forested swamps, being on average more wet than forested swamps and more dry than marshes. However, it is also frequent for them to dominate entire wetland systems. Hardwood-dominated stands (especially Fraxinus latifolia) may be considered a shrub swamp when they are not surrounded by conifer forests but do not occur in Alaska. Typical landscape for the Fraxinus latifolia stands were very often formerly dominated by prairies and now by agriculture. Wetland species, including Carex aquatilis var. dives (= Carex sitchensis), Carex utriculata, Equisetum fluviatile, and Lysichiton americanus, dominate the understory. On some sites, Sphagnum spp. are common in the understory (Stikine, Yakutat Forelands, Copper River Delta).
2	Alaska	14	614	01.D.1.D014M156E614	2679	Alaska Sub-boreal White Spruce-Hardwood Forest	This ecological system is widespread in south-central Alaska on well-drained upland terrain. Picea glauca and Betula papyrifera are typically codominant in an open canopy.
2	Alaska	15	615	01.D.1.D014M156E615	2677	Alaska Sub-boreal White-Lutz Spruce Forest and Woodland	This system occurs in the boreal transition of Alaska on well-drained upland terrain. Picea glauca or Picea X lutzii are the dominant conifers, although Betula papyrifera, Populus balsamifera, and Populus tremuloides are often present. Common shrubs include Menziesia ferruginea, Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata, Vaccinium ovalifolium, Oplopanax horridus, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Linnaea borealis. Common herbaceous species include Calamagrostis canadensis, Equisetum arvense, Dryopteris expansa, and Gymnocarpium dryopteris. The major disturbance processes include fire, human disturbance, blowdown and insect infestations.
2	Alaska	16	616	01.D.1.D014M156E616	2642	Aleutian Kenai Birch-Cottonwood-Poplar Forest	These hardwood-dominated forests are common on the eastern Alaska Peninsula and on Kodiak Island. This system occurs at low elevations and also at the upper elevational limit of broad-leaved trees. At low elevations it is found predominantly on well-drained, gentle lower hillslopes, large moraines, and old riparian terraces, although floodplain stands of cottonwood are not included in this system. Patch size is typically small to large. Total hardwood tree species cover is >25% and dominated by Betula papyrifera var. kenaica, Betula papyrifera, Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa, or Populus balsamifera. Tree height ranges from 6 to 21 m. Understory shrubs include Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata, Salix barclayi, Rubus spectabilis, and Sambucus racemosa. Herbaceous species may also dominate the understory, such as Athyrium filix-femina, Calamagrostis canadensis, Calamagrostis lapponica, Chamerion angustifolium ssp. angustifolium, Equisetum spp., Gymnocarpium dryopteris, and Heracleum maximum.
2	Alaska	17	617	01.D.1.D014M156E617	2622	Western North American Boreal Black Spruce Wet-Mesic Slope Woodland	This system occurs on north-facing slopes underlain by permafrost with low productivity Picea mariana. Soils are poorly drained and acidic with a well-developed peat layer. Sites on lower concave slopes and toeslopes are wet, while sites on upper slopes, convex slopes and ridges may be mesic. Common species include Ledum groenlandicum, Ledum palustre ssp. decumbens, Betula nana, Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium uliginosum, Carex spp., and Sphagnum spp. This system has less Sphagnum than Western North American Boreal Black Spruce Dwarf-Tree Peatland (CES105.139). The slope angle is generally greater than 8 degrees.
2	Alaska	18	618	01.D.1.D014M156E618	2605	Western North American Boreal Mesic Birch-Aspen Forest	This hardwood system is common on well-drained upland terrain on south, west, and east aspects in the boreal region of interior Alaska, and extends south and east into the territories and provinces of western Canada. It is also widespread in the boreal transition region in south-central Alaska on well-drained upland terrain. Betula papyrifera is typically dominant in the canopy in Alaska, but other dominants or subdominants include Populus balsamifera and Populus tremuloides. In western Alberta, Populus tremuloides is much more abundant, often forming extensive forests across large areas. Stands are often closed-canopied with an open shrub or herbaceous understory. Canopy cover typically ranges from 25 to 90%. Common understory species include Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Ledum spp., Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium myrtilloides, Betula nana, Betula glandulosa, Rosa acicularis, Ribes triste, Linnaea borealis, Shepherdia canadensis, and Viburnum edule. This represents a persistent, often self-replacing, hardwood system and may represent a long-term seral stage of any one of several boreal systems where white spruce is important. Spruce may be present in the canopy and, in the absence of fire, could potentially occupy the site.
2	Alaska	19	619	01.D.1.D014M156E619	2604	Western North American Boreal Mesic Black Spruce Forest	This ecological system is common throughout upland slopes and inactive alluvial deposits in the boreal region of Alaska east into Yukon Territory, and east into the western provinces and territories of Canada. It is widespread in south-central Alaska on well-drained sites, including old alluvial plains, abandoned floodplains, and inactive terraces. Soils are well-drained, and permafrost may be absent. The Picea mariana forests in the Northern Rockies represent the southernmost extent of these expansive boreal forests. The southern limit appears to be related to July mean temperatures exceeding 65 degrees F and maximum of 75 degrees F, and where annual precipitation drops below 38-50 cm (15-20 inches). Picea mariana is typically the dominant species in mature stands, though Picea glauca may be codominant on some sites. Common understory species include Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Empetrum nigrum, and Linnaea borealis. Feathermosses (Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi) are common in mature stands. Lichens may be an important component in late-seral stages. In the eastern part of its range, it intermingles with and transitions to Western Canadian Boreal Mesic Black Spruce-Lodgepole Forest (CES105.515) and Western Canadian Boreal Mesic Mixed Conifer-Hardwood Forest (CES105.510).
2	Alaska	20	620	01.D.1.D014M156E620	2600	Western North American Boreal White Spruce Forest	This ecological system is common throughout interior Alaska and extends south and eastward into adjacent provinces and territories of Canada into western Alberta. The montane Picea glauca forests in the Northern Rockies represent the southernmost extent of these expansive boreal forests. The southern limit appears to be related to July mean temperatures exceeding 65 degrees F and maximum of 75 degrees F, and where annual precipitation drops below 38-50 cm (15-20 inches). The landscape is typically rolling hills formed by drumlins, kettle-kame, stabilized dunes, moraines, lacustrine deposits, loess deposits, eskers, and bedrock outcrops and sometimes mountain slopes. This system is composed of multi-aged stands of Picea glauca and the subdominants Betula papyrifera, Populus tremuloides, and Picea mariana. Picea glauca associations found in Banff, Jasper, Kootenay and Yoho national parks occur on gentle to moderate slopes and are generally very mature stands. Mature stands are often open-canopied with a well-developed shrub layer. Common understory shrubs include Rosa acicularis, Viburnum edule, Ledum palustre ssp. decumbens, Ledum groenlandicum, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium uliginosum, Empetrum nigrum, Betula nana, and Linnaea borealis. Common herbaceous species include Geocaulon lividum, Pyrola spp., Equisetum sylvaticum, Equisetum arvense, and Mertensia paniculata. Feathermosses such as Abietinella abietina, Hylocomium splendens, and Pleurozium schreberi are common in the ground layer (Boggs and Sturdy 2005). The disturbance regime is characterized by large crown fires, though other disturbances, such as insect infestations and blowdown are common.
2	Alaska	21	621	01.D.1.D014M156E621	2603	Western North American Boreal White Spruce-Hardwood Forest	This system is common on well-drained upland terrain on south, west, and east aspects. Picea glauca codominates with Betula papyrifera and/or Populus tremuloides, and the mixed stands are persistent for over 75 years.
2	Alaska	22	622	01.D.1.D014M179E622	2602	Western North American Boreal Spruce-Lichen Woodland	This system occurs primarily in the northern and western portion of boreal Alaska (west, northeast and northwest boreal) and less commonly in the western and southwestern boreal transition (Nulato Hills and Ahklun Mountains). These are cool dry sites on well-drained to excessively well-drained substrates. Soils are thin and develop on gravels, sandy loess deposits, or bedrock and are likely free of permafrost. Forest canopy is dominated by Picea glauca or Picea mariana, and cover is generally between 10% and 25%. The shrub layer is open and typically features low and dwarf-shrubs including Betula nana, Shepherdia canadensis, Arctostaphylos rubra, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Vaccinium uliginosum, or Empetrum nigrum. Lichens (primarily Cladina spp.) are an important component of the understory in mature stands. Feathermosses are not as important as in other white spruce systems.
2	Alaska	23	623	01.D.1.D014M179E623	2607	Western North American Boreal Subalpine Balsam Poplar-Aspen Woodland	Stands of Populus balsamifera ssp. balsamifera and Populus tremuloides occur along south-facing upper slopes with trees generally persisting in smaller size classes (seedling, sapling and pole). Clones often grow above the elevation limit of Picea glauca and into the subalpine zone. This system occurs commonly throughout the mountain ranges of south-central Alaska and also near the northern and western limit of the boreal region, and may be advancing in some areas. Small stands of Populus balsamifera occur on the north slope of the Brooks Range on valley bottoms and on sideslopes.
2	Alaska	24	624	01.D.1.D014M179E624	2601	Western North American Boreal Treeline White Spruce Woodland	This ecological system occurs primarily near the elevational and latitudinal limits of white spruce tree growth. Soils are cold, but peat-forming mosses are not common in the ground layer. Forest canopy is dominated by Picea glauca and cover is generally between 10% and 25% (40%). In some locations Alnus viridis is the dominant understory shrub. The shrub layer typically features Betula nana, but other low shrubs such as Vaccinium uliginosum, Ledum groenlandicum, and Salix spp. may be common or dominant. In the western and southwestern portions of the boreal transition region, lichens are commonly abundant in the understory.
2	Alaska	25	625	01.D.2.D016M299E625	2624	Western North American Boreal Deciduous Shrub Swamp	Shrub swamps occur throughout the boreal and boreal transition regions of Alaska on poorly drained, fine-textured soil. Depressions with standing water are common throughout the growing season. Soils range from muck to mineral and are relatively nutrient-rich. Some sites have a thin peat layer. The shrub layer is typically dominated by Alnus incana ssp. tenuifolia, but Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata, Salix pulchra, or Salix richardsonii (= Salix lanata ssp. richardsonii) may be dominant or codominant. Common understory species include Calamagrostis canadensis, Equisetum spp., Comarum palustre (= Potentilla palustris), and hydrophytic mosses.
2	Alaska	26	626	01.D.2.D016M299E626	2630	Western North American Boreal Wet Black Spruce-Tussock Woodland	This ecological system is common throughout boreal Alaska on north-facing slopes, gentle hills, and inactive alluvial surfaces underlain by permafrost. Soils are poorly drained and consist of tussocks over peat or mineral soil. Picea mariana is the dominant overstory species in an open to woodland canopy. Tussock-forming sedges contribute at least 25% of the vegetation cover. Common understory shrubs include Betula nana, Ledum palustre ssp. decumbens, Ledum groenlandicum, Vaccinium uliginosum, and Vaccinium vitis-idaea. Herbaceous species include Eriophorum vaginatum, Carex bigelowii, and Rubus chamaemorus. Mosses may be abundant and include Sphagnum spp. and Hylocomium splendens.
2	Alaska	27	627	01.D.2.D016M300E627	2728	Aleutian Floodplain Forest and Shrubland	This floodplain system includes active and inactive forested floodplains and outwash plains, and is mosaiced with Aleutian Floodplain Wetland (CES105.296). Forested floodplains and outwash plains are widespread on Kodiak Island and the eastern Alaska Peninsula, but absent from the Aleutian Islands. The substrate is typically well-drained sand or cobble alluvium, although finer silts and clays are found on higher terraces, on distal floodplains, and in lower energy systems. Permafrost is absent. Patch size is small to large and often linear. These are rivers that always have a tree-dominated component. The primary existing vegetation types are: tall willow, alder (Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata), mesic herbaceous meadows on the younger deposits, and cottonwood-poplar (Populus balsamifera or Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa) on the older sites. The cottonwood-poplar stands often have an understory of tall willow, Calamagrostis canadensis, ferns and scattered forbs. Floodplains dominated by volcanic ash deposits, the largest being the Katmai River floodplain, are included.
2	Alaska	28	628	01.D.2.D016M300E628	2615	Western North American Boreal Lowland Large River Floodplain Forest and Shrubland	This system includes large floodplains associated with high-volume interior rivers (such as the Yukon, Kuskokwim, Koyukuk, and Tanana rivers). Flooding regime is characterized by large spring floods at ice break-up. Young successional stages are dominated by willow and alder followed by balsam poplar and/or white spruce. Wetland development in abandoned channels is intermixed with succession on more mesic sites [see description for Western North American Boreal Shrub and Herbaceous Floodplain Wetland (CES105.118)]. The active flooding zone is often several km wide. Permafrost is usually absent.
2	Alaska	29	629	01.D.2.D016M300E629	2614	Western North American Boreal Montane Floodplain Forest and Shrubland	This system includes glacially-fed and non-glacially-fed rivers and streams throughout the boreal and boreal transition regions of Alaska. It includes the active and inactive portions of the floodplain, but not abandoned floodplains. Soils are alluvial, well-drained and poorly developed. Frequent river channel migration and associated flooding and fluvial processes constitute the major disturbances in this type. On glacially-fed rivers, braided outwash plains occur near the glacier terminus. This portion of the river is characterized by high sediment input and very frequent flooding. Substrates are excessively well-drained and frequently scoured. A high proportion of barren and early-seral landscape classes characterize the outwash plain. Farther downstream (distal outwash), vegetation dominance on the floodplain depends on seral stage and frequency of flooding: later seral stages and wetlands become more common. On rivers and streams without major glacial inputs, flooding and sediment deposition still drive the disturbance cycle; however, the timing and severity of flooding may differ from that on glacial rivers. Both glacially-fed and non-glacially-fed rivers are characterized by young successional stages dominated by willow and alder followed by extensive stands of balsam poplar and/or white spruce. Floodplains range in width from less than 50 m to over 1 km. Large floodplains (several km wide, such as the Yukon) are classified as separate systems. Oxbows and other wet depressions commonly form on the floodplains. Wetland succession and species composition are variable due to diverse environmental conditions such as water depth, substrate, and nutrient input. Wetland classes and succession are described in the floodplain wetlands ecological system.
2	Alaska	30	630	01.D.2.D016M300E630	2616	Western North American Boreal Riparian Stringer Forest and Shrubland	This system occurs throughout the boreal and boreal transition regions of Alaska and is characterized by low-energy riparian communities. These riparian zones are typically narrow bands of forest or shrubs along streams in low-gradient and low-volume drainages. Seasonal overbank flooding may occur, but generally it does not result in shifting channels or gravel bar formation. Common species include Picea glauca, Betula papyrifera, Populus balsamifera, Alnus spp., Salix spp., Carex spp., and Calamagrostis canadensis.
2	Alaska	31	631	02.C.1.D022M172E631	2680	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Avalanche Slope Shrubland	This system occurs on mountain sideslopes from sea level to treeline where slopes are steep enough to produce frequent snowslides preventing forest development. Mass wasting, including rockfall and soil creep, also contributes to the disturbance cycle. This system is similar in species composition to Alaskan Pacific Maritime Subalpine Alder-Salmonberry Shrubland (CES204.152), but it occurs below the subalpine zone, and tree growth is limited by disturbance frequency, not elevation and temperature as in the subalpine system. Sites are usually dominated by Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata and Rubus spectabilis. Other shrubs may include Sambucus racemosa, Salix alaxensis, Salix barclayi, and Oplopanax horridus. Herbaceous patches are common and are dominated by Calamagrostis canadensis and Chamerion angustifolium. Other common herbs include Athyrium filix-femina, Veratrum viride, Heracleum maximum, Streptopus amplexifolius, and Aruncus dioicus. Near treeline, forb-sedge meadows replace Calamagrostis meadows. Tree seedlings and saplings may be abundant on some slopes but do not emerge as an overstory due to frequent disturbance.
2	Alaska	32	632	02.C.1.D022M172E632	2653	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Mesic Herbaceous Meadow	This ecological system includes a wide variety of herbaceous vegetation types and occurs below subalpine shrublands on sideslopes, rolling hills, and alluvial deposits. Soils are typically mesic, well-drained, and underlain by colluvium, alluvium, glacial till or residuum. Vegetation may be dominated by forbs, graminoids, or ferns. The most common dominant species are Calamagrostis canadensis and Chamerion angustifolium. One or more of the following species can also be dominant: Veratrum viride, Athyrium filix-femina, or Heracleum maximum. Other common species may include Lupinus nootkatensis, Aconitum delphiniifolium, Sanguisorba canadensis, Senecio triangularis, and Nephrophyllidium crista-galli.
2	Alaska	33	633	02.C.1.D022M172E633	2652	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Subalpine Alder-Salmonberry Shrubland	This ecological system typically occurs just above treeline and below the alpine throughout the maritime region of Alaska. Soils are typically mesic, well-drained, shallow, and stony, and underlain by colluvium, glacial till or residuum. Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata is often the dominant species, but Rubus spectabilis may be codominant. Other common species include Sambucus racemosa, Oplopanax horridus, and Elliottia pyroliflorus. The tall shrub system is often mosaiced with the mesic herbaceous meadow system. Common herbaceous species include Calamagrostis canadensis, Chamerion angustifolium, Veratrum viride, Heracleum maximum, Athyrium filix-femina, Dryopteris expansa, Phegopteris connectilis, Equisetum arvense, Streptopus amplexifolius, Lupinus nootkatensis, Valeriana sitchensis, Geranium erianthum, Aconitum delphiniifolium, Castilleja unalaschcensis, Sanguisorba canadensis, and Carex macrochaeta.
2	Alaska	34	634	02.C.1.D022M172E634	2718	Aleutian Mesic Alder-Salmonberry Shrubland	The alder-salmonberry system is matrix-forming on the Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak Island, diminishes moving west, and is absent by Dutch Harbor. It occurs on flat to steep slopes (0-50 degrees) at low to mid elevations (1-1000 m) in valleys, hills and mountains. The slopes are typically ash-covered, colluvium, or glacial drift. Total low- and tall-shrub cover is >25%, and Alnus viridis or Rubus spectabilis contribute greater than 50% of the total shrub cover. Rubus spectabilis is dominant primarily on the oldest stabilized talus slopes and stable colluvial slopes (older substrates), while Alnus viridis may be the dominant shrub on recently disturbed sites, wind-sheltered sites or recent ash deposits. Common codominants include Sambucus racemosa, Oplopanax horridus, Spiraea stevenii, and tall willows such as Salix barclayi or Salix glauca. Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata is the most common alder species, however, Alnus viridis ssp. fruticosa dominates some sites. Alder height ranges from 0.5 m at higher elevations to 8 m downslope. In closed-canopy sites, Sambucus racemosa and Rubus spectabilis shrubs are usually woven in among and around the edges of the alder thickets, and the understory is sparse, often with Athyrium filix-femina, graminoids and sparse Rubus spectabilis. Litter cover is high. Sites codominated by tall willows typically occur along streams and at the upper limits of alder growth. Some Rubus spectabilis sites are mixed with herbaceous species of equal height, including Athyrium filix-femina, Aconitum maximum, Calamagrostis canadensis, Chamerion angustifolium ssp. angustifolium, Deschampsia caespitosa, Dryopteris expansa, Heracleum maximum, and Veratrum viride. In sites where patches of alder are mosaiced with mesic herbaceous meadows, common species include Athyrium filix-femina, Aconitum maximum, Calamagrostis canadensis, Chamerion angustifolium ssp. angustifolium, Deschampsia caespitosa, Dryopteris expansa, Heracleum maximum, Lupinus nootkatensis, Solidago spp., and Veratrum viride.
2	Alaska	35	635	02.C.1.D022M172E635	2651	Aleutian Mesic Herbaceous Meadow	This ecological system occurs on all slopes and aspects with a mesic moisture regime, including windswept coastal headlands, coastal bluffs, old beach ridges, hillside slopes, stabilized talus, alluvial fans, and ravine sideslopes, and commonly forms a mosaic with alder patches. Patch size is small to matrix-forming. Herbaceous cover is >25%, Leymus mollis cover is <25%. This system includes four predominant vegetation types: (1) The Athyrium filix-femina meadow type is dominated by Athyrium filix-femina with Veratrum viride, Heracleum maximum, Streptopus amplexifolius, Angelica lucida, and Calamagrostis canadensis; (2) The Chamerion angustifolium ssp. angustifolium meadow type is dominated by Chamerion angustifolium ssp. angustifolium, usually with ferns, Calamagrostis canadensis, and often Heracleum maximum; (3) The Calamagrostis canadensis meadow type is dominated by Calamagrostis canadensis, usually with ferns and scattered forbs. It is common on disturbed sites (human or natural) that are in early stages of recovery; and (4) The mixed herbaceous meadow type includes mesic herbaceous meadows not dominated by Athyrium filix-femina, Chamerion angustifolium ssp. angustifolium, or Calamagrostis canadensis; these species, however, often codominate. Common forbs include Lupinus nootkatensis, Solidago canadensis var. lepida, Polemonium acutiflorum, Castilleja unalaschcensis, Sanguisorba canadensis, Veratrum viride, Valeriana capitata, Antennaria dioica, Cardamine oligosperma var. kamtschatica, Achillea millefolium var. borealis, Arnica unalaschcensis, Dendranthema arcticum ssp. arcticum, Claytonia sibirica, Geum calthifolium, Ranunculus occidentalis, Dryopteris expansa, and Angelica lucida. Graminoids include Carex macrochaeta, Festuca rubra, Agrostis exarata, Agrostis scabra, and Deschampsia beringensis. Empetrum nigrum may also be common.
2	Alaska	36	636	02.C.1.D022M172E636	2731	Aleutian Oval-leaf Blueberry Shrubland	This ecological system grows primarily on low- to mid-elevation mountain slopes of the Aleutian Islands. Total low-shrub cover is >25%, and Vaccinium ovalifolium typically contributes >50% of the total shrub cover. Herbaceous species and dwarf-shrubs are common, including Athyrium filix-femina, Chamerion angustifolium ssp. angustifolium, Calamagrostis canadensis, Cornus suecica, Sanguisorba canadensis, Achillea millefolium var. borealis, and Geum calthifolium. Empetrum nigrum may also be common.
2	Alaska	37	637	02.C.2.D025M055E637	2713	Alaska Arctic Active Inland Dune	Inland active dunes are a minor but widespread system across the Alaskan arctic. The dunes or blowouts are dry to mesic sand deposits, and the slacks may be wet silts and sands. This system's patch size is small. Some common vegetation types include those dominated by low and tall willows, mesic herbaceous meadows, and wet sedge meadows. Low- and tall-willow communities are dominated by Salix glauca, Salix alaxensis, and Salix niphoclada (= Salix brachycarpa ssp. niphoclada), along with Bromus inermis var. pumpellianus (= Bromus pumpellianus). The mesic herbaceous meadows include Leymus mollis, Bromus inermis var. pumpellianus, and Chamerion latifolium (= Epilobium latifolium). Additional herbaceous species include Carex obtusata, Carex lachenalii, Festuca rubra, Festuca brachyphylla, Astragalus alpinus, and others. Ponds and wet depressions may occur in the slacks and support wet herbaceous communities dominated by Carex aquatilis and Arctophila fulva.
2	Alaska	38	638	02.C.2.D025M055E638	2699	Alaska Arctic Mesic Herbaceous Meadow	This mesic herbaceous system occurs throughout arctic Alaska on hill and mountain slopes, upper drainages, and lowlands including drained lake basins. It typically occurs as small patches and is more common in the western arctic. This system occurs on mesic sites with >25% cover of herbaceous species. Species include Carex microchaeta ssp. nesophila (dominant sedge in higher elevations), Alopecurus alpinus, Artemisia arctica, Polygonum bistorta, Valeriana capitata, Pedicularis spp., Polemonium acutiflorum, Salix rotundifolia, and Salix reticulata. Collapsed acidic lowland snowbeds that support Phippsia algida and Alopecurus alpinus and drained lake basins dominated by Calamagrostis canadensis (western Alaska) are also included in this system.
2	Alaska	39	639	02.C.2.D025M055E639	2608	Alaska Sub-boreal Avalanche Slope Shrubland	This system occurs commonly throughout the boreal transition region and infrequently in boreal Alaska on mountain slopes where slopes are steep enough to produce frequent snow slides thus preventing forest development. Slopes that produce regular avalanches typically have an upper slope angle of at least 70%, but the lower slopes and run-out zones may be much less steep. The dominant shrub species is typically Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata, but other shrubs, including Sambucus racemosa, Salix spp., and Spiraea stevenii, may be common. Herbaceous patches are often dominated by Calamagrostis canadensis and Chamerion angustifolium; other common herbs include Athyrium filix-femina, Dryopteris expansa, and Veratrum viride. Tree seedlings and saplings may be common on some slopes but do not emerge as an overstory due to frequent snow avalanche.
2	Alaska	40	640	02.C.2.D025M055E640	2609	Alaska Sub-boreal Mesic Subalpine Alder Shrubland	This system is widespread on upper mountain slopes above treeline throughout south-central and southwestern Alaska. It occurs less commonly throughout the northern boreal region to the southern slopes of the Brooks Range. This system often appears as a band of alder above treeline and below alpine systems. Low shrub replaces this system as the dominant subalpine shrub type in the northern boreal region of the state. Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata is the dominant shrub species, but other shrubs including Salix spp. (sometimes the dominant shrub), Sambucus racemosa, and Spiraea stevenii (= Spiraea beauverdiana) may be common. In the boreal transition region, the alder zone is intermixed with mesic herbaceous meadows (Calamagrostis canadensis and Chamerion angustifolium); in boreal Alaska, low-shrub tundra is more common in the gaps between alder patches.
2	Alaska	41	641	02.C.2.D025M055E641	2640	Aleutian Mesic-Wet Willow Shrubland	This willow shrubland system is relatively uncommon yet widespread on the eastern Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak Island at low to mid elevations (range of 3-657 m in Katmai National Park and Preserve) and diminishes moving west. It typically occurs as small patches in broad valleys, on mountain sideslopes with slopes ranging from 0 to 30 degrees. It is also frequently found on wet sites in lowlands, along streams, terraces, lakeshores and the edge of small streams, as well as adjacent to peatlands and wet meadows. Some sites are not wet and support predominantly tall willows, but this is probably <10% of sites. The soil substrates range from mineral to peat. Total tall- and low-shrub cover (>20 cm height) is >25%, and Salix spp. contribute greater than 25% of the total shrub cover. The dominant willow species is Salix barclayi, although Salix alaxensis, Salix commutata, Salix glauca, and Salix pulchra are also important. Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata may codominate. Understory shrub species include Betula nana, Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Vaccinium uliginosum. Understory herbaceous species include Achillea millefolium var. borealis, Angelica lucida, Calamagrostis canadensis, Chamerion angustifolium ssp. angustifolium, Equisetum arvense, Geranium erianthum, Heracleum maximum, Rubus arcticus, and Sanguisorba canadensis. Wetter sites support Carex lenticularis var. lipocarpa, Carex aquatilis var. aquatilis, Carex utriculata, and Equisetum pratense.
2	Alaska	42	642	02.C.2.D025M055E642	2613	Western North American Boreal Active Inland Dune	Active inland dunes occur in boreal Alaska and western Canada as remnants of larger systems of dunes and sandsheets that developed under the climatic conditions of the late Pleistocene. Strong storm winds carried glacio-fluvial silts and sands across vast areas of northwestern North America. Most of these sand deposits have been stabilized by forest and tundra vegetation, but areas of active transport and deposition still exist. Some of the most noteworthy active areas are the Kobuk Dunes in western Alaska, the Carcross Dunes in southern Yukon, and the Lake Athabasca Dunes in northern Saskatchewan. These active dunes share many floristic elements and geomorphic processes. The main disturbance process is the transport and deposition of sand. Common landforms include transverse and longitudinal dunes, sandsheets, desert pavements, blowouts, and interdune slacks. Three dominant habitat types occur within boreal active dune systems: grassy, dry mountainous and boreal forest.
2	Alaska	43	643	02.C.2.D025M055E643	2633	Western North American Boreal Alpine Mesic Herbaceous Meadow	This ecological system occurs throughout boreal Alaska on gentle slopes in subalpine and alpine environments. Carex bigelowii is the dominant species. Other common species may include Luzula confusa and lichens. Dwarf-shrubs such as Arctostaphylos alpina, Empetrum nigrum, Salix pulchra, and Betula nana are usually present, but contribute less than 25% to the canopy cover. This system may form a mosaic with dwarf- and low-shrub systems.
2	Alaska	44	644	02.C.2.D025M055E644	2606	Western North American Boreal Dry Aspen-Steppe Bluff	This ecological system occurs commonly on moderately steep to very steep, south-facing slopes and windswept bluffs throughout the boreal and boreal transition regions of Alaska. Generally, the substrate is steep, unstable, dry mineral soil. This system is common above major rivers and is often associated with river bluffs above treeline. Soils are typically well-drained to excessively well-drained and develop on glacial, loess, or fluvial deposits or residual material. Soils are often unstable and rocky; outcrops are common. The system is a mosaic of open forests or woodlands, low shrub-dominated patches, or dry meadows. At increasing elevation, trees become less important, and at subalpine or low alpine locations, shrubs are the dominant lifeform. Tree patches are dominated by Populus tremuloides, but Picea glauca may also be present. Patches of low-shrub and dry herbaceous communities are interspersed within the aspen forest, where it occurs. Common shrubs include Artemisia frigida, Artemisia alaskana, Juniperus communis, and Arctostaphylos uva-ursi. Important grasses include Pseudoroegneria spicata (= Agropyron spicatum), Bromus inermis var. pumpellianus (= Bromus pumpellianus), Calamagrostis purpurascens, Festuca altaica, and Poa spp.
2	Alaska	45	645	02.C.2.D025M055E645	2612	Western North American Boreal Dry Grassland	This system occurs across the boreal and boreal transition regions of Alaska on dry sideslopes or well-drained lowland sites. Soils are well-drained to excessively drained and permafrost is absent. These sites are typically dominated by grasses, though forbs may codominate on some sites. Shrub cover is less than 25%. Common species include Festuca altaica, Festuca rubra, Calamagrostis purpurascens, Leymus innovatus (= Elymus innovatus), Artemisia frigida, and Achillea spp.
2	Alaska	46	646	02.C.2.D025M055E646	2610	Western North American Boreal Mesic Scrub Birch-Willow Shrubland	This ecological system occurs throughout the boreal and boreal transition regions of Alaska on mesic sites on mid- to upper slopes, above treeline and on flats and sideslopes. Betula nana usually dominates the shrub layer, but Vaccinium uliginosum, Ledum palustre ssp. decumbens, Salix pulchra, Salix barclayi, or other Salix spp. may also be common. Salix spp. may occasionally be dominant. Dwarf-shrubs such as Empetrum nigrum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea may be common under the low-shrub layer. Herbaceous species are sparse, but feathermosses (Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi) and lichens may be common. Sites with organic soils are not included in this type.
2	Alaska	47	647	02.C.2.D025M055E647	2611	Western North American Sub-boreal Mesic Bluejoint Meadow	This ecological system occurs throughout the boreal and boreal transition regions of Alaska, and extends south and east into western Canada. Soils are typically fine-textured mineral and may be poorly drained (on flats) to well-drained (on sideslopes). In the boreal transition region, mesic Calamagrostis canadensis meadows often occur near treeline interspersed with subalpine tall shrub. Its elevational limit is just above the limit of tall shrubs (within 100 m). This system appears to be less common north of the Alaska Range. Mesic meadows also occur as seral stages in drained lakebeds, or after disturbance such as fire or logging. The vegetation is usually dense, with canopy height of 0.8 to 1.4 m, occasionally reaching 2 m. Species composition ranges from nearly pure stands of Calamagrostis canadensis to mixtures of Calamagrostis canadensis with forbs, such as Chamerion angustifolium. Forb- or fern -dominated patches also occur. Common forbs and ferns include Heracleum maximum, Thalictrum spp., Veratrum viride, Angelica lucida, Athyrium filix-femina, Dryopteris expansa, and Equisetum arvense. Short-term mesic meadow seral stages, such as post-fire Chamerion angustifolium, are considered seral stages of the forested system they replaced and not included in this description.
2	Alaska	48	648	02.C.3.D027M058E648	2671	Aleutian American Dunegrass Grassland	Sites are level to steep. The substrates are commonly dunes or shallow to deep eolian sand deposits over bedrock, sometimes 2 km inland. This system is not subjected to typical coastal processes such as overwash. The sites may be unstable, including eroding coastal bluffs and isolated blowouts. Other sites have loamy soils on colluvium that are nutrient-enriched by seabirds. Sites may or may not receive salt spray. Patch size is small to large. Leymus mollis cover is >25%, and the sites are not part of Aleutian Marine Beach and Beach Meadow (CES105.239). Other dominant or codominant species include Festuca rubra, Heracleum maximum, Ligusticum scoticum, Angelica lucida, and Claytonia sibirica. Some sites have 1- to 2-foot tall tussocks. Recent research has shown that the abundance of graminoids in the Aleutian Islands has been significantly reduced due to a reduction in nutrient inputs from seabird colonies; where seabirds have been impacted by introduced predators, the cover of graminoid species is lower.
2	Alaska	49	649	02.C.3.D027M058E649	2725	Aleutian Marine Beach and Beach Meadow	This ecological system consists of coastal beaches, beach dunes, and vegetation that has stabilized sand deposits. Cobble beaches are also included. Soils are dry to mesic (occasionally tidally inundated) and typically sandy. Patch size is small to moderate and often linear. This system sometimes grades into sandy loess deposits on rolling hills dominated Aleutian American Dunegrass Grassland (CES105.233). Three different vegetation types occur in this system: salt-tolerant forb communities, Leymus mollis grasslands, and Empetrum nigrum shrublands. Bare sand or cobble are also common. Salt-tolerant forb communities occur just above mean high tide and are dominated or codominated by Cochlearia groenlandica, Achillea millefolium var. borealis, Honckenya peploides, and/or Mertensia maritima. As dune height and distance from the ocean increase, sites are dominated by Leymus mollis communities that may include near-monocultures of Leymus mollis to more species-rich associations, including Leymus mollis, Lathyrus japonicus var. maritimus, Achillea millefolium var. borealis, Festuca rubra, Fragaria chiloensis, Senecio pseudoarnica, Deschampsia beringensis, Heracleum maximum, and Poa eminens. Empetrum nigrum-dominated communities often grow in narrow stringers on the older beach ridges behind the Leymus mollis zone. Herbaceous species are common, including Cornus suecica. The Leymus mollis and Empetrum nigrum existing vegetation types are above the high tide line but still experience storm surges, high winds and salt spray.
2	Alaska	50	650	02.C.3.D027M058E650	2716	Aleutian Rocky Headland and Sea Cliff	This ecological system includes rocky headlands and sea cliffs. Sea cliffs typically occur below 50 m elevation; however, on some extremely exposed cliffs, such as those on outer headlands, salt spray from winter storms may affect cliffs at 100-200 m elevation. Vegetation cover is typically sparse to absent. Frequent exposure to salt spray distinguishes this system from inland and alpine rock outcrops and cliffs. In addition to salt spray, wind and wave erosion, desiccation, and slope failures create a harsh growing environment. Forbs, grasses and shrubs establish on ledges and in cracks. On Amchitka Island, Shacklette et al. (1969) described several sea cliff communities, including Eurhynchium-Puccinellia-Caloplaca, Potentiea-Draba-Saxifraga, Xanthoria-Ramalina, and (on less steep cliffs) Leymus-Ligusticum-Anemone. On the Alaska Peninsula, dominance may shift to Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata, Rubus spectabilis, Aruncus dioicus var. acuminatus, Heuchera glabra, Potentilla villosa, Phegopteris connectilis, Carex macrochaeta, Deschampsia spp., Lupinus nootkatensis, Campanula spp., and Chamerion latifolium.
2	Alaska	51	651	02.C.3.D027M-NeE651	2709	Alaska Arctic Marine Beach and Beach Meadow	This system consists of coastal beaches, beach dunes, and vegetation that has stabilized sand or cobble deposits. Soils are dry to mesic and typically sandy. Patch size is small to moderate and often linear. Two different physiognomic structures are found in the system: Leymus mollis grasslands and dwarf-shrublands; bare sand or cobble are also common. Salt-tolerant forb communities occur just above mean high tide and are dominated or codominated by Cochlearia groenlandica, Achillea millefolium var. borealis, Honckenya peploides, and/or Mertensia maritima. As dune height and distance from the ocean increase, sites are dominated by Leymus mollis communities that may include near-monocultures of Leymus mollis to more species-rich associations including Leymus mollis, Lathyrus japonicus var. maritimus (= Lathyrus maritimus), and Poa eminens. Older dunes support dwarf-shrubs (primarily Empetrum nigrum) mixed with herbaceous species which often grow in narrow stringers on the older beach ridges behind the Leymus mollis zone. Lathyrus japonicus var. maritimus, Conioselinum chinense, and Cnidium cnidiifolium are uncommon east of Cape Lisburne. The Leymus mollis and Empetrum nigrum zones are above the high tide line but still experience storm surges, high winds and salt spray.

2	Alaska	62	662	02.C.4.D029M063E662	2656	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Shrub and Herbaceous Floodplain Wetland	Floodplain wetlands occur within the active and inactive portions of floodplain systems. Wetlands develop on poorly drained deposits, oxbows, and abandoned channels and are often mosaiced with well-drained floodplain vegetation. Frequent river channel migration and associated flooding and fluvial processes constitute the major disturbances. Wetland succession and species composition are variable due to diverse environmental conditions such as water depth, substrate, and nutrient input. Floodplain wetland vegetation includes the following classes: aquatic bed, freshwater marsh, fen, wet low shrub, and tall-shrub swamp. These have been described as unique systems in this classification, but because floodplain wetland dynamics are different from wetland dynamics outside the floodplain, we will consider floodplain wetlands a distinct system, and model succession accordingly.
2	Alaska	63	663	02.C.4.D029M063E663	2660	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Wet Low Shrubland	This wetland system typically occurs as a ring on the outer edge of peatlands or on uplifted tidal marshes that are relatively wet but no longer tidally influenced. It is a minor yet widespread system wherever mature peatlands and uplifted tidal marshes occur, such as the Copper River Delta and Yakutat Forelands. It also occurs on old lakebeds, drained beaver ponds, wet depressions, and the edge of tidal marshes. Soils are saturated for at least a portion of the growing season, and generally have a wet organic layer of variable depth (8 cm to 1 m deep) over silt, sand or gravel. The shrub layer is dominated by Myrica gale and/or Vaccinium uliginosum. In Katmai National Park and Preserve, Myrica gale is the dominant shrub, but Betula nana or Salix barclayi may also codominate. Species richness is often high and composition is variable.

2	Alaska	67	667	02.C.5.D031M072E667	2729	Aleutian Floodplain Wetland	"Floodplain wetlands occur within the active and inactive portions of the floodplain systems (""floodplain forest and shrub"" and ""floodplain herbaceous meadow and shrub""). Wetlands develop on poorly drained deposits, oxbows, and abandoned channels, and are often mosaiced with well-drained floodplain vegetation. River channel migration, flooding and other fluvial processes constitute the major disturbance in this system. Wetland succession and species composition is variable due to diverse environmental conditions such as water depth, substrate, and nutrient input. This floodplain wetland system includes the following existing vegetation types: freshwater aquatic beds, freshwater marshes, wet meadow and herbaceous peatland - complex, and Aleutian Mesic-Wet Willow Shrubland (CES105.148). These have been described as unique systems in this classification, but because floodplain wetland dynamics are different from wetland dynamics outside the floodplain, floodplain wetlands are considered a distinct system, and model succession accordingly. Each type, however, has the same species composition as its correspondingly named system."
2	Alaska	68	668	02.C.5.D031M072E668	2722	Aleutian Freshwater Marsh	Freshwater marshes typically occur with other wetland systems on the margins of ponds and lakes. They are mostly small patch, semipermanently flooded, but some have seasonal flooding. Water is at or above the surface for most of the growing season. Soils are muck or mineral. Freshwater marshes have >10% cover of emergent herbaceous vegetation. Species include Carex aquatilis, Carex utriculata, Menyanthes trifoliata, Comarum palustre, Equisetum fluviatile, Equisetum palustre, and Hippuris spp. Species of Eriophorum do not commonly occur in this system. Species diversity is often low.
2	Alaska	69	669	02.C.5.D031M072E669	2727	Aleutian Shrub and Herbaceous Meadow Floodplain	This ecological system includes active and inactive unforested floodplains and outwash plains, and is mosaiced with Aleutian Floodplain Wetland (CES105.296). Small unforested floodplains and outwash plains are widespread in the Aleutian Islands and Alaska Peninsula. The substrate is typically well-drained sand or cobble alluvium, although finer silts and clays are found on higher terraces, on distal floodplains, and in lower energy systems (capped by an organic mat). Permafrost is absent. Patch size is small to large and often linear. These floodplains have several different kinds of plant communities, including shrublands dominated by tall or low willow, or alder (Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata), and mesic herbaceous meadows, or Leymus mollis grasslands. The tall willow, alder and mesic herbaceous types tend to dominate low-elevation floodplains on Kodiak Island and the Alaska Peninsula. The mesic herbaceous and Leymus mollis existing vegetation types dominate the Aleutian Island floodplains. Calamagrostis spp. is the dominant mesic herbaceous species, and others include Athyrium filix-femina, Leymus mollis, Gymnocarpium dryopteris, Geranium richardsonii, Fritillaria camschatcensis, Heracleum maximum, and Chamerion angustifolium ssp. angustifolium. Floodplains dominated by volcanic ash deposits are included.
2	Alaska	70	670	02.C.5.D031M072E670	2625	Western North American Boreal Freshwater Emergent Marsh	Freshwater marshes are found throughout boreal transition and boreal regions of western and northern Alaska. They are characterized by emergent herbaceous vegetation. Freshwater marshes typically occur with other wetland systems. They occur on the margins of ponds, lakes, and riparian systems and on inland deltas where rivers drain into large lakes. Inland marshes are mostly small patch, confined to limited areas in suitable floodplain or basin topography. They are typically semipermanently flooded, but some marshes have seasonal flooding. Water is at or above the surface for most of the growing season (typically 10 cm above the surface). Soils are muck or mineral, and water is nutrient-rich. These systems are highly productive and have high rates of decomposition. Freshwater marsh vegetation is dominated by emergent vegetation such as Carex utriculata, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani (= Scirpus validus), Typha latifolia, Menyanthes trifoliata, and Equisetum fluviatile. Arctophila fulva becomes more common in the northern portions of boreal Alaska.
2	Alaska	71	671	02.C.5.D031M072E671	2617	Western North American Boreal Shrub and Herbaceous Floodplain Wetland	This system occurs within the active and inactive portions of floodplains. Wetlands develop on poorly drained deposits, oxbows, and abandoned channels and are often mosaiced with well-drained floodplain vegetation. Frequent river channel migration and associated flooding and fluvial processes constitute the major disturbances. Wetland succession and species composition are variable due to diverse environmental conditions such as water depth, substrate, and nutrient input. Floodplain wetland vegetation includes the following classes: aquatic bed, freshwater marsh, fen, and wet low shrub. These have been described as unique systems in this classification, but because floodplain wetland dynamics differ from wetland dynamics outside the floodplain, we will consider floodplain wetlands a distinct system and model succession accordingly. Wetland succession beginning in open water can proceed through the following wetland classes: aquatic bed, marsh, wet meadow or fen. Over time, fens can succeed to shrub bogs or wet low shrub. At any stage in succession, flooding can set back the vegetation to open water. Less dramatic changes in hydrology (such as an increase in water table from beaver activity) can reverse the direction of succession. Wetlands can also develop through paludification on poorly drained, fine-textured deposits.
2	Alaska	72	672	02.C.5.D031M072E672	2626	Western North American Boreal Wet Meadow	This ecological system is common throughout the boreal and boreal transition regions of Alaska in wet depressions, low-lying areas, and shallow drainage ways. These systems are minerotrophic with high nutrient levels and high rates of decomposition. Soils are mineral or muck and are saturated at some point during the growing season, but do not have standing water (water may be up to 5-10 cm deep during portions of the growing season, but it is not persistent). Wet meadows typically have a well-developed organic mat but not deep enough to be considered peatlands. Wet meadow vegetation may be seral to fens. Dominant species include Carex aquatilis, Carex utriculata, Carex lasiocarpa, Eriophorum angustifolium, Calamagrostis canadensis, and Equisetum palustre. Comarum palustre, Menyanthes trifoliata, Equisetum fluviatile are often present but not dominant. Shrubs may be a minor component of the canopy cover (less than 25% cover) and include Myrica gale, Alnus incana ssp. tenuifolia, and Salix spp.
2	Alaska	73	673	02.C.5.D031M073E673	2676	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Alpine Floodplain	This system includes active alpine and subalpine floodplains and consists of a complex of riparian vegetation, including gravel bars, herbaceous vegetation, and dwarf-, low, or tall shrub. Riparian zones are characterized by frequent flooding, shifting channels, and transport and deposition of alluvium. Tall and low shrubs reach their maximum elevation in riparian zones. This may be due to protection of the valley bottom and deeper winter snowpack or the favorable growing conditions of the riparian zone. Flooding regime and soil moisture control the pattern of vegetation cover. Common species occurring in frequently flooded areas include Chamerion latifolium, Chamerion angustifolium, Lupinus nootkatensis, Salix spp., and Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata. Species occurring in more stabilized areas of the floodplain may include Salix reticulata, Salix arctica(?), Phyllodoce aleutica, Harrimanella stelleriana, Luetkea pectinata, and Sanguisorba canadensis.
2	Alaska	74	674	02.C.5.D031M073E674	2673	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Alpine Wet Meadow	This small-patch ecological system often occurs as a mosaic of alpine wetlands including headwater fens, marshes, and riparian zones. Common species include Salix reticulata, Salix stolonifera, Viola spp., Lupinus nootkatensis, Mimulus guttatus, Mimulus lewisii, Petasites frigidus var. frigidus, Sanguisorba canadensis, and Leptarrhena pyrolifolia; Valeriana sitchensis, Castilleja parviflora, Ranunculus spp., Caltha spp., and Saxifraga spp. often occur along streambanks. Peatlands and associated wet meadows and marshes often feature Trichophorum caespitosum, Carex anthoxanthea, and Juncus mertensianus.
2	Alaska	75	675	02.C.5.D031M073E675	2665	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Coastal Meadow and Slough-Levee	This ecological system includes moist and wet meadows associated with delta deposits, uplifted marshes, or beach deposits. These meadows occur inland of tidal marshes and are also common along sloughs and levees. Meadows are dominated by a wide variety of graminoids and forbs, including Deschampsia beringensis, Festuca rubra, Argentina egedii (= Potentilla egedii), Lathyrus japonicus var. maritimus, Castilleja spp., Heracleum maximum, Parnassia palustris, Lupinus nootkatensis, Achillea millefolium var. borealis (= Achillea borealis), Angelica lucida, and Carex mackenziei. Leymus mollis and Lupinus nootkatensis are common on levees, and Carex lyngbyei often dominates in sloughs and wet depressions.
2	Alaska	76	676	02.C.5.D031M073E676	2661	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Fen and Wet Meadow	This ecological system includes herbaceous wetlands in fens (not including bogs) and non-peatlands. The fen/wet meadow system may be dominated either by sedges, sedges with a variety of forbs, or forbs. The organic layer ranges from thick to thin, and may be composed of sphagnum, sedge, or other organic material and can occur over mineral soil, or may be floating or submerged. Rich fens consistently feature Carex aquatilis var. dives (= Carex sitchensis), although a variety of other sedges and forbs may be present, including Dodecatheon pulchellum, Parnassia fimbriata, Eriophorum russeolum, Menyanthes trifoliata, and Comarum palustre. Ericaceous shrubs are absent. Bryophytes (when present) include Calliergon giganteum, Sphagnum squarrosum, and Sphagnum riparium. Mixed sedge and forb meadows include Carex saxatilis, Carex lyngbyei, Sanguisorba canadensis, Swertia perennis, and Platanthera dilatata. Forb-dominated sites include Equisetum fluviatile, Comarum palustre (= Potentilla palustris), and Menyanthes trifoliata.
2	Alaska	77	677	02.C.5.D031M073E677	2672	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Subalpine Copperbush Shrubland	This ecological system occurs in the lower alpine and subalpine. Elliottia pyroliflorus dominates the overstory (10 to 80% cover) and ranges in height from 0.6-1.5 m (2-5 feet). Other species include Phyllodoce aleutica, Nephrophyllidium crista-galli, Cornus suecica, Luetkea pectinata, Athyrium filix-femina, Cassiope mertensiana, Dryopteris expansa, Gymnocarpium dryopteris, Viola glabella, and Rubus spectabilis. Krummholz Tsuga mertensiana occur in some sites. Adjacent to this system at higher elevations are alpine herbaceous meadows or dwarf-shrublands; at lower elevations Tsuga mertensiana forests or woodlands are common.
2	Alaska	78	678	02.C.5.D031M073E678	2662	Temperate Pacific Freshwater Emergent Marsh	Freshwater marshes are found at all elevations below timberline throughout the temperate Pacific Coast and mountains of western North America. In the Pacific Northwest, they are mostly small-patch, confined to limited areas in suitable floodplain or basin topography. They are mostly semipermanently flooded, but some marshes have seasonal hydrologic flooding. Water is at or above the surface for most of the growing season. Soils are muck or mineral (in Alaska typically muck over a mineral soil), and water is high-nutrient. Occurrences of this system typically are found in a mosaic with other wetland systems. It is often found along the borders of ponds, lakes or reservoirs that have more open basins and a permanent water source throughout all or most of the year. Some of the specific communities will also be found in floodplain systems where more extensive bottomlands remain. By definition, freshwater marshes are dominated by emergent herbaceous species, mostly graminoids (Carex, Scirpus and/or Schoenoplectus, Eleocharis, Juncus, Typha latifolia) but also some forbs. Common emergent and floating vegetation includes species of Scirpus and/or Schoenoplectus, Typha, Eleocharis, Sparganium, Sagittaria, Bidens, Cicuta, Rorippa, Mimulus, and Phalaris. Maritime Alaska freshwater marshes are described as having Carex rostrata, Equisetum fluviatile (often pure stands), Carex aquatilis var. dives (= Carex sitchensis), Menyanthes trifoliata, Comarum palustre, Eleocharis palustris, and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani. In relatively deep water, there may be occurrences of the freshwater aquatic bed system, where there are floating-leaved genera such as Lemna, Potamogeton, Polygonum, Nuphar, Hydrocotyle, and Brasenia. A consistent source of freshwater is essential to the function of these systems.
2	Alaska	79	679	02.C.6.D035M081E679	2712	Alaska Arctic Coastal Brackish Meadow	This coastal brackish meadow system typically occurs immediately above tidal marshes in arctic Alaska. It has >25% herbaceous cover and <25% shrub cover. These sites are tidally inundated during storm tides and extreme high tides and, consequently, are brackish. The soils typically lack organics, and permafrost is uncommon. The main indicators on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and the Kotzebue Sound lowlands ecoregions are Carex rariflora (>10%), Calamagrostis deschampsioides, and Dendranthema arcticum (= Chrysanthemum arcticum). Other common species include Eriophorum russeolum, Carex ramenskii (usually present but not dominant), and Salix ovalifolia. Additional dominants on the Beaufort Coastal Plain are Eriophorum angustifolium, Carex aquatilis, and Dupontia fisheri.
2	Alaska	80	680	02.C.6.D035M081E680	2701	Alaska Arctic Coastal Sedge-Dwarf-Shrubland	This system typically occurs immediately above coastal brackish meadows or tidal marshes in arctic Alaska. These are tidal deposits that are only periodically tidally flooded and typically have permafrost. It is a dominant system on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, but occurs elsewhere along the arctic Alaska coast. It has >25% dwarf- and low-shrub cover and >25% herbaceous cover. Dominant dwarf-shrubs are Empetrum nigrum, Salix fuscescens, Salix ovalifolia, and sometimes Betula nana. Diagnostic herbaceous species are Carex rariflora, Calamagrostis deschampsioides, Deschampsia caespitosa, and Puccinellia andersonii. Additional species include Dupontia fisheri, Arctagrostis latifolia, Alopecurus alpinus, Tanacetum bipinnatum (= Chrysanthemum bipinnatum), and Petasites frigidus.
2	Alaska	81	681	02.C.6.D035M081E681	2710	Alaska Arctic Tidal Flat	Tidal flats are subject to regular tidal inundation, have <10% vascular species cover, and are dominated by bare ground or algae. This system often forms a narrow band along oceanic inlets, deltas, and tidal marshes. Algae are the dominant vegetation.
2	Alaska	82	682	02.C.6.D035M081E682	2711	Alaska Arctic Tidal Marsh	This system consists of herbaceous marshes with >10% vascular species cover that are subject to regular tidal inundation. The marshes are salt or brackish. Some are primarily freshwater that are infrequently flooded during storm surges or extreme high tides. Tidal marshes are primarily associated with estuaries or coastal lagoons or other locations protected from wave action. Two different types of tidal marshes are included in this system: tidal sedge marshes and tidal herbaceous (non-sedge) marshes. Carex ramenskii or Carex subspathacea dominate the tidal sedge marshes. Carex subspathacea is more common along the Beaufort Sea. Carex lyngbyei may dominate on portions of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and is often found more inland or adjacent to tidal creeks. Dupontia fisheri and Puccinellia spp. dominate the tidal herbaceous marshes. Argentina egedii (= Potentilla egedii) may dominate on Alaska's west coast but not on the Beaufort Coastal Plain.
2	Alaska	83	683	02.C.6.D035M081E683	2726	Aleutian Tidal Marsh	This system consists of herbaceous marshes with >10% vascular species cover that are subject to regular tidal inundation. The marshes are typically salt or brackish. Some, however, are primarily freshwater that are infrequently flooded by storm surges or extreme high tides. Tidal marshes are primarily associated with estuaries or coastal lagoons or other locations protected from wave action. Lagoons with outer spits and beaches are well developed and common in the Aleutians. Tidal marshes, however, are not extensive within these lagoons because of constant winds and waves, plus winter sea ice may be extensive and blown to shore, battering the vegetation. It appears that tectonic/isostatic uplift is common, lifting the marshes above the tide. Two existing vegetation types dominate the system: tidal sedge and tidal herbaceous. Carex lyngbyei, Carex glareosa, and Carex mackenziei dominate the tidal sedge class. Other species include Hippuris tetraphylla, Hippuris vulgaris, Ruppia cirrhosa, Stellaria humifusa, and Zannichellia palustris. Puccinellia spp. or Plantago maritima dominate the tidal herbaceous type, often with <25% cover.
2	Alaska	84	684	02.C.6.D035M081E684	2668	Temperate Pacific Tidal Salt and Brackish Marsh	"Intertidal salt and brackish marshes are found throughout the Pacific Coast, from Kodiak Island and south-central Alaska to the central California coast. They are primarily associated with estuaries or coastal lagoons. Salt marshes are limited to bays and behind sand spits or other locations protected from wave action. Typically these areas form with a mixture of inputs from freshwater sources into coastal saltwater, so they commonly co-occur with brackish marshes. This is a small-patch system, confined to specific environments defined by ranges of salinity, tidal inundation regime, and soil texture. Patches usually occur as zonal mosaics of multiple communities. They vary in location and abundance with daily and seasonal dynamics of freshwater input from inland balanced against evaporation and tidal flooding of saltwater. Summer-dry periods result in decreased freshwater inputs from inland. Hypersaline environments within salt marshes occur in ""salt pans"" where tidal water collects and evaporates. Characteristic plant species include Distichlis spicata, Monanthochloe littoralis, Limonium californicum, Jaumea carnosa, Salicornia spp., Suaeda spp., Batis maritima, and Triglochin spp. Low marshes are located in areas that flood every day and are dominated by a variety of low-growing forbs and low to medium-height graminoids, especially Salicornia virginica, Distichlis spicata, Schoenoplectus maritimus (= Scirpus maritimus), Schoenoplectus americanus (= Scirpus americanus), Carex lyngbyei, and Triglochin maritima. In Alaska, tidal marshes are often dominated by near-monotypic stands of Carex lyngbyei, while the frequently inundated lower salt marshes are often dominated by Eleocharis palustris or Puccinellia spp. Other common species in Alaska include Hippuris tetraphylla, Plantago maritima, Cochlearia groenlandica (= Cochlearia officinalis), Spergularia canadensis, Honckenya peploides, or Glaux maritima. In the Cook Inlet and Alaska Peninsula, Carex ramenskii may be an associated species. High marshes are located in areas that flood infrequently and are dominated by medium-tall graminoids and low forbs, especially Deschampsia caespitosa, Argentina egedii, Juncus balticus, and Symphyotrichum subspicatum (= Aster subspicatus), and in Alaska Poa eminens, Argentina egedii, Festuca rubra, and Deschampsia caespitosa. Transition zone (slightly brackish) marshes are often dominated by Typha spp. or Schoenoplectus acutus. Atriplex prostrata (= Atriplex triangularis), Juncus mexicanus, Phragmites spp., Cordylanthus spp., and Lilaeopsis masonii are important species in California. The invasive weed Lepidium latifolium is a problem in many of these marshes. Rare plant species include Cordylanthus maritimus ssp. maritimus."
2	Alaska	85	685	04.B.1.D043M101E685	2645	Alaska Sub-boreal and Maritime Alpine Mesic Herbaceous Meadow	These are mesic subalpine and alpine herbaceous meadows that occur on mountain sideslopes in the boreal transition and maritime regions of Alaska. The slope position is often above the tall-shrub zone and below alpine dwarf-shrub tundra, and the slope shape is usually straight to concave. The substrate is colluvium, residuum, or glacial till. This system often occurs as a continuous band above or mixed with subalpine and alpine shrublands on moderate to steep slopes underlain by colluvium, talus, or bedrock. Species composition is diverse and species richness is often very high, typically no single species is dominant. Vegetation is dominated by herbaceous species, including Carex macrochaeta, Geranium erianthum, Sanguisorba canadensis, Valeriana sitchensis, Lupinus nootkatensis, Veratrum viride, Aconitum delphiniifolium, Anemone narcissiflora, Polemonium acutiflorum, Chamerion angustifolium (= Epilobium angustifolium), Chamerion latifolium, Senecio triangularis, Nephrophyllidium crista-galli, Calamagrostis canadensis (often present but not dominant), Castilleja unalaschcensis, Artemisia arctica, Fritillaria camschatcensis, and Athyrium filix-femina. The dominant disturbances are snow avalanche, soil creep and freeze-thaw action.
2	Alaska	86	686	04.B.1.D043M101E686	2643	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Alpine Dwarf-Shrubland	This system occurs primarily on alpine and subalpine sites of southeastern, maritime Alaska, but it can also be found at lower elevations (e.g., Kenai Fjords and Prince William Sound). It occurs on sideslopes, shoulder slopes, and low summits, and the terrain varies from gently sloping to steep. The vegetation can be a mosaic of herbaceous meadow and alpine heath (dwarf-shrublands) or herbaceous meadow with a heath understory; however, in some areas dwarf-shrub cover is continuous. Dominant dwarf-shrub species include Empetrum nigrum, Phyllodoce aleutica, Phyllodoce glanduliflora, Cassiope mertensiana, Cassiope tetragona, Harrimanella stelleriana, and Luetkea pectinata. Other common species may include Vaccinium uliginosum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Loiseleuria procumbens. Ericaceous species typically dominate this type, but sites dominated by Salix arctica and Salix reticulata are included in this system. Scattered tall shrubs and dwarf trees may be present. Common herbaceous species include Carex macrochaeta, Lupinus nootkatensis, Valeriana sitchensis, Geranium erianthum, Aconitum delphiniifolium, Castilleja unalaschcensis, Sanguisorba canadensis, Anemone narcissiflora, Artemisia arctica, and Viola spp. On slopes on the outer coast and also in Kenai Fjords and Prince William Sound Nephrophyllidium crista-galli is common in this system
2	Alaska	87	687	04.B.1.D043M101E687	2674	Alaskan Pacific Maritime Alpine Sparse Shrub and Fell-field	This sparsely vegetated ecological system occurs on exposed summits, windswept ridges, and fell-fields. These sites are characterized by harsh environmental conditions. Slopes vary from moderately sloped to flat. Dominant species include Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium uliginosum, Loiseleuria procumbens, Phyllodoce aleutica, Harrimanella stelleriana, and Luetkea pectinata. Lichens may be common. Total vegetation cover ranges from 10 to 25%.
2	Alaska	88	688	04.B.1.D043M101E688	2719	Aleutian Crowberry-Herbaceous Heath	This system is common in valley bottoms, sideslopes, stabilized dunes, terraces, moraines and fans. Patch size is small to matrix forming. It typically occupies lower elevation sites than Aleutian Mixed Dwarf-Shrub-Herbaceous Shrubland (CES105.231). Dwarf-shrub cover is >25% and dominated by Empetrum nigrum; herbaceous cover is variable, ranging from none to well over 50%. Other dwarf-shrub species include dwarf willows, Harrimanella stelleriana, Phyllodoce aleutica, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Arctostaphylos alpina. Herbaceous species include Lupinus nootkatensis, Polemonium acutiflorum, Chamerion angustifolium, Solidago spp., and grasses. A more abundant herbaceous component, particularly graminoids, may be due to nutrient inputs from seabird colonies; where seabirds have been impacted by introduced predators, the cover of herbaceous species appears to be lower (Croll et al. 2005). Fruticose lichens and Racomitrium lanuginosum may also be common. Heath hummocks may occur.
2	Alaska	89	689	04.B.1.D043M101E689	2720	Aleutian Mixed Dwarf-Shrub-Herbaceous Shrubland	This is a common system throughout the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands from low to high elevations. It occurs in valleys, terraces, sideslopes, and ridges. In the mountains, this system often grades upslope into the Aleutian sparse heath and fell-field system. The continuous dwarf-shrub heaths often fragment into strips that alternate with almost bare ground, possibly due to wind erosion and frost action. In this system, dwarf-shrub cover is >25%, not dominated by Empetrum nigrum, and herbaceous cover varies from none to 75%. Various dwarf-shrub species dominate or codominate, including Harrimanella stelleriana, Phyllodoce aleutica, Salix arctica, Salix rotundifolia, Cassiope lycopodioides, Loiseleuria procumbens, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium uliginosum, and Arctostaphylos alpina. While Empetrum nigrum may codominate, it is mixed with other dwarf-shrubs. Common herbaceous species include Carex macrochaeta, Chamerion angustifolium, Deschampsia caespitosa, Lupinus nootkatensis, Leymus mollis, Geum calthifolium, Carex circinata, Polygonum viviparum, and Festuca rubra. Bryophyte cover is often high.
2	Alaska	90	690	04.B.1.D043M101E690	2730	Aleutian Sparse Heath and Fell-Field	This system typically occurs at mid to high elevations on cliffs, rocky outcrops, exposed summits, windswept ridges, and fell-fields characterized by harsh environmental conditions. Slopes vary from flat to steep. Total vascular plant cover is 10-25%. Sites typically support vegetation similar to the adjacent ecological systems. The higher elevation windswept ridges, fell-fields and discontinuous heaths include Harrimanella stelleriana, Phyllodoce aleutica, Salix arctica, Salix rotundifolia, Empetrum nigrum, Cassiope lycopodioides, and Arctostaphylos alpina.

Common herbaceous species include Antennaria alpina, Hierochloe alpina, Minuartia obtusiloba, Carex scirpoidea, Carex podocarpa, Carex microchaeta, and Festuca altaica. Mosses such as Tortula ruralis and Polytrichum spp. may be common. Lichens include Cladina spp., Sphaerophorus globosus, Nephroma arcticum, Flavocetraria spp., and Alectoria ochroleuca. In the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve and Cape Krusenstern National Monument (Jorgenson et al. 2004), this system differs from non-acidic Dryas by lacking the calciphilic species Saxifraga oppositifolia, Potentilla uniflora, Hedysarum boreale ssp. mackenziei (= Hedysarum mackenziei), and Oxytropis nigrescens.
2	Alaska	92	692	04.C.1.D044M173E692	2691	Alaska Arctic Acidic Dwarf-Shrub Lichen Tundra	This is a common system on acidic substrates in the hills and mountains of arctic Alaska. This system does not occur in arctic lowlands. Common slope positions include valleys, sideslopes, and summits and ridges.

Common dwarf-shrubs include Dryas octopetala, Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium uliginosum, Dryas integrifolia, Salix phlebophylla, Antennaria alpina, Hierochloe alpina, Festuca altaica, and Carex microchaeta. Mosses may be present but contribute little cover.
2	Alaska	93	693	04.C.1.D044M173E693	2685	Alaska Arctic Acidic Sparse Tundra	This is a common system on acidic substrates (pH typically <6) in the hills and mountains of arctic Alaska. This system does not occur in the arctic lowlands. Common slope positions include valleys, sideslopes, and summits and ridges. The canopy is sparse due to extreme exposure, exposed bedrock or unstable substrates. Sites are typically dry to mesic and occur on acidic substrates. Soils are typically thin, stony, and well-drained. Patch size is small to matrix-forming. Total vascular plant cover is 10-25%, and lichen cover is <25%.

Common herbaceous species include Hierochloe alpina, Boykinia richardsonii, Carex microchaeta, Carex scirpoidea, Geum glaciale, Pedicularis lanata, Eriophorum angustifolium ssp. triste, and Equisetum spp. Mosses such as Rhytidium rugosum, Aulacomnium turgidum, Distichium capillaceum, Racomitrium lanuginosum, Dicranum elongatum, and Polytrichum sp. may be common.
2	Alaska	95	695	04.C.1.D044M173E695	2715	Alaska Arctic Floodplain	This ecological system includes active and inactive glacially- and non-glacially-fed floodplains.
