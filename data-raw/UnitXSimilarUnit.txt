689444	687266	dry oak woodland is somewhat related. Both communities have canopies of 30-80%, but opening woodlands are found on loamier soils and dominated by <i>Quercus alba, Quercus macrocarpa</i>, and <i>Quercus rubra</i> (reaching dominance on more mesic stands only). Dry oak woodlands are found on droughty, sandy soils and are dominated by <i>Quercus ellipsoidalis, Quercus velutina</i> and <i>Quercus alba</i>. Their highly droughty, low-fertility soils lead to low fuel loads that often allow for only low-intensity fires. Woody individuals which survive the sapling stage generally reach canopy size as the intensities of fire in this community are rarely high enough to kill overstory trees (Anderson 1991). Many understory species are shared in common between dry-mesic oak woodlands and dry oak woodlands. Understory species that are either unique to or more common in dry oak woodlands are those that compete well only in acidic, low-nutrient sandy soils or those that compete well only under more droughty conditions. Conversely, species unique to or more common in dry-mesic oak woodlands tend to be more competitive under lower moisture stress conditions and/or prefer more alkaline conditions.

684120	685481	has some floristic similarities to the more mesic <i>Pinus ponderosa / Quercus macrocarpa</i> communities. <i>Pinus ponderosa / Quercus macrocarpa</i> communities are distinguished by a greater percentage of <i>Quercus macrocarpa</i> and an abundance of <i>Spiraea betulifolia</i> and <i>Mahonia repens</i> in lieu of <i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>.
688173	685481	
684396	685481	is very similar and shares many species and environmental conditions with the woodland. The woodland may be a more mesic relative of the forest. The presence of <i>Oryzopsis asperifolia</i> is the most distinguishing characteristic of the forest.

689444	683694	a northern oak forest has a more-or-less closed canopy (canopy &gt;80%). It is found on nutrient-poor, drought-prone soils that preclude establishment of more nutrient-demanding trees such as <i>Acer saccharum</i>. Northern oak forests occur on sites protected from intense fires; otherwise they would be converted to oak woodland or <i>Corylus americana</i> shrubland. Even though the canopy is generally closed, the canopy architecture of oaks allows enough sunlight to penetrate to the oak forest understory such that oak forests and oak woodlands share many understory species in common. Oak forests are dominated by shrubs that are taller, since the shrubs are not consumed by intense fires. These taller shrubs produce enough shade to reduce the herbaceous component of oak forests in comparison to oak woodlands. Some understory species common in oak woodlands appear unable to compete with the shade of shrubs and saplings in oak forests.
687965	683694	This type is dominated by <i>Quercus ellipsoidalis</i>. In Wisconsin, these two species hybridize and traditionally <i>Quercus velutina</i> is treated as occurring south of the tension zone and <i>Quercus ellipsoidalis</i> north of it.

689008	684976	
684181	684976	
686587	684561	is similar in that stands of both share shrub layers dominated by <i>Rhus trilobata</i> and herbaceous layers dominated or codominated by <i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i> and containing a number other graminoids and forbs. Following Mueggler and Stewart (1980), the diagnostic difference between the two associations is the contribution by <i>Festuca idahoensis</i> of at least 5% canopy cover to stands of CEGL001505. Stands containing less than 5% canopy cover of <i>Festuca idahoensis</i> belong to CEGL001120. This treatment differs from that of Hansen and Hoffman (1988), who take the presence of any amount of <i>Festuca idahoensis</i> as indicating vegetation of the <i>Rhus trilobata / Festuca idahoensis</i> habitat type.

689322	683172	is found only in the tallgrass region.
684248	689943	Northern Oak Barrens are closely related. Both have canopies of 10-30%, but Openings are found on loamier soils and dominated by <i>Quercus macrocarpa</i> and/or <i>Quercus alba</i> (occasionally codominated by <i>Quercus velutina</i>) whereas barrens are found on highly sandy soils and are dominated by <i>Quercus velutina</i> or <i>Quercus ellipsoidalis</i>. Many understory species are shared in common. Understory species that are either unique to or more common in barrens are those that compete well only in acidic, low-nutrient, sandy soils or those that compete well only under very high moisture stress levels (which tend to be higher in barrens than in openings). Species with both high light and high pH or nutrient requirements are found only in Openings.

684248	686363	Wet-mesic Prairie shares a surprising number of understory species that reach peak abundance in both communities (Packard 1993, Pruka 1994). These understory species (e.g., <i>Dodecatheon meadia, Galium boreale, Hypoxis hirsuta, Lathyrus venosus, Silene stellata</i>) appear to require both high direct sunlight levels and low moisture stress conditions. Thus they are found both in open prairies that are wet enough to meet their transpiration needs and in openings that are open-canopied enough to meet their light needs but closed-canopied enough to reduce transpiration stress and allow them to compete on drier soils (Pruka 1994, Bray 1958).

860262	860256	These rainforests are typically much taller, with multiple strata and growth forms, but as elevations increase (up to 1000 m), a transition occurs to lower elevation Tropical Montane Humid Forest.
860239	860269	Dwarf mangroves may grade into tropical salt marshes.
860239	860267	As concentrations of salts decline, Mangrove (F006) may grade into this formation.
860227	860232	There is a strong dominance by broad-leaved evergreen trees, and deciduousness is caused by drought rather than forest composition.
860227	860233	Tree cover is &lt;10%.
860255	860273	The vegetation is more commonly scrub-shrub, typically sclerophyllous, or with open (sometimes annual-dominated) grasslands and forb meadows. Combinations of dwarf scrubby trees &lt;2 m tall with low shrubs may grade into Warm Temperate Forest.
860261	860241	These typically contain well-drained soils, and lack any aquatic vegetation, peat or muck layer.
860261	860255	These typically contain well-drained soils, and lack any aquatic vegetation, peat or muck layer.
860261	860268	Tall-shrub swamps share many structural and habitat similarities to hardwood tree swamps, especially during the tree regeneration stage.
860236	860237	
860245	860273	The vegetation tends to produce highest biomass in the cool winters, and become dormant in the summer hot periods. Above-ground portions of perennial grasses dry and wither, or annuals set seed and die by late spring.
860245	860250	Typically with small leaved, xerophytic shrubs (e.g., sage) and more open bare ground, sometimes with biological crust.
860214	860215	These cultural wetlands may have a vegetation structure that is regularly managed (e.g., rice paddies), the water levels may be regularly manipulated, or the shores of the wetland may be highly modified by concrete, berms, etc.
867667	860245	Pastures may overlap in composition with native grasslands, particularly in grassland regions. In regions where a pastoral tradition has existed from hundreds to thousands of years, recognition of native versus agricultural grasslands may be challenging.
868705	686425	a similar blackwater swamp forest of the NC and SC Coastal Plain.
868705	689198	a more diverse swamp forest of habitats intermediate between blackwater and brownwater conditions, and in which <i>Taxodium distichum, Nyssa aquatica</i>, and <i>Fraxinus caroliniana</i> are much more important.
867664	860241	Long-rotation plantations or woody restoration plantings with an irregular structure and a largely spontaneous ground layer may initially be similar in their early stages of development, especially if planted in rows and the understory is strongly manipulated.
867667	860246	Pastures may overlap in composition with native grasslands, particularly in grassland regions. In regions where a pastoral tradition has existed from hundreds to thousands of years, recognition of native versus agricultural grasslands may be challenging.
860267	860256	Overall dominant growth forms are similar, but forest structure is more complex in Tropical Lowland Humid Forest, and the soils are not saturated or inundated. Tree palms and lianas are more common.
860237	860261	These forests less often contain a sphagnum peat layer and are more commonly dominated by hardwood species.
860237	860236	These typically contain better drained soils, lack any aquatic vegetation or muck layer, and, if a peat layer is present, is shallow (&lt;40 cm).
860217	860215	Forests found in urban parks and lawns may have an irregular horizontal spacing but a highly regular or mowed understory and are placed in this developed vegetation class. Forests, such as orchards, typically have either a very regularly spaced tree canopy (often pruned or trained) and/or plowed or regularly manipulated ground layer (e.g., tree-shaded shrub or herb crops).
860217	860211	When grasses and shrubs dominate the ground layer and tree cover is near but &gt;10%, is clumped, or overtopped by grasses and shrubs, there may be cases where assignment to this class is preferable. Short mesomorphic trees that do not overtop shrubs and herbs are placed in this class. However, in tropical upland savanna regions, stands may have 40% tree cover, where trees are &lt;8 m tall, tree regeneration is sparse to absent, and there is a substantial graminoid layer.
860217	860216	Occasionally xeromorphic trees may be sufficiently dense to form woodland stands (e.g., saguaro, Joshua tree, microphyllous-leaved mesquite woodlands, tropical thorn woodlands). The dominance of xeromorphic growth forms places these stands in the Desert &amp; Semi-Desert class rather than Forest &amp; Woodland.
860211	860215	Agricultural grasslands in this class may be regularly mowed, hayed or grazed, and have an atypical "cut" structure periodically throughout the season, and may be dominated by exotic grasses. Developed grasslands in this class have a very regularly, often very low, cropped structure because of regular cutting or mowing (even weekly during the growing season).
860211	860213	Distinguishing cryomorphic vegetation from mesomorphic can be a challenge in both arctic and alpine regions. Here we allow mesomorphic extensions into the cryomorphic climatic zone to be retained in the mesomorphic class (e.g., boreal mesomorphic tall willow shrublands along arctic drainageways are excluded from Cryomorphic Vegetation), whereas prostrate or dwarf willow species are treated as part of the cryomorphic class.
860211	860218	Sparsely vegetated sand dunes are similar to this class, but the vascular species present are typically mesomorphic, with adaptations to rooting in sand (psammophytic); crustose lichens and ferns are typically absent. Unstable scree may also contain scattered mesomorphic herbs and little to no nonvascular vegetation, but for now are retained in this class.
860213	860211	Distinguishing cryomorphic vegetation from mesomorphic vegetation can be a challenge in both arctic and alpine regions. Here we allow mesomorphic extensions into the cryomorphic climatic zone to be retained in the mesomorphic class (e.g., boreal mesomorphic tall willow shrublands along arctic drainages, or the tropics, lower elevation expressions of high montane páramo and puna in South America).

833254	833214	are coastal forests characterized by <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii - Lithocarpus densiflorus</i>, at generally lower elevations.
860838	860831	is differentiated by the dominance of <i>Salix alaxensis</i> and location on active floodplains.
860767	860745	
860821	860853	is dominated by dwarf-shrubs in the <i>Salix</i> genus.
860747	860771	
849242	860830	is very similar but limited to the coastal maritime climates and lacks <i>Picea engelmannii</i>.
849282	860830	
860740	860886	extends into the boreal region.
860213	860216	In high montane deserts, the xeromorphic desert growth forms will transition to cryomorphic growth forms. Review is needed to see where issues may arise between temperate alpine and dry deserts or tropical high montane puna and high deserts.
860213	860218	This class is restricted to cryptogam-dominated sites associated with mesomorphic vegetation, as found in tropical, temperate and boreal vegetation regions.
860218	860216	Dry habitats with sparse vegetation on rocky surfaces. When xeromorphic plants have &gt;10% cover on rocky substrates, or, if &lt;10%, are the dominant growth present, stands are classified as xeromorphic vegetation.
860218	860213	In either extreme alpine habitats or in polar deserts, the vegetation will be limited to growing on rocks and become so sparse as to qualify as lithomorphic vegetation. But where the vegetation typically has &gt;10% cover of total vascular vegetation (excluding ferns and allies), and is dominated by cryomorphic growth forms, it belongs in this class. This class also includes stands in polar regions where the vascular vegetation has extensive moss or fruticose or foliose lichen (but not crustose lichen) and is on mineral soil (i.e., lichen tundra vegetation).
860218	860211	In moist climates, cliff, talus, scree, and rock outcrops can contain inclusions of mesomorphic vegetation, but the lithomorphic substrate limits their cover. Where mesomorphic cover is &gt;10% of total vascular vegetation (excluding ferns and allies), the vegetation is placed in this class.
860221	877233	Although in some cases there may be difficulty distinguishing natural from agricultural ponds, in the large majority of cases, they are distinct in ecological setting, edges, and in composition.
860258	860254	This formation contains high montane vegetation that is at or near treeline in the tropics, but is not subject to regular freezing or affected by cryogenic soil processes. In the Neotropics we place páramo and puna in this formation because they predominantly do not have cryogenic soils or experience frost.
860258	860250	At high altitudes in the tropics, these cool or rather hot/cold deserts share some characteristics of cryomorphic vegetation because of the freezing temperatures.
860228	860233	Cool Semi-Desert Scrub &amp; Grassland (S11) typically has small-leaved, xerophytic shrubs (e.g., sage) and more open bare ground, sometimes with biological crust.
860273	860255	The vegetation contains tree growth forms with &gt;10% cover. Combinations of dwarf scrubby trees &lt;2 m with low shrubs may grade into Warm Temperate Forest.
860273	860245	The vegetation tends to produce highest biomass in the warm to hot summers and become dormant in the winter cool or cold periods. Above-ground portions of perennial grasses dry and wither, or annuals set seed and die by late fall.
860221	877231	Although in some cases there may be difficulty distinguishing natural from agricultural ponds, in the large majority of cases, they are distinct in ecological setting, edges, and in composition.
872780	860360	occurs further south in warmer, desert climates of western North America.
860360	872765	occurs in the far western maritime and montane regions of western North America.
860360	872780	occurs generally further north and/or in more montane environments in western North America.
687455	892978	
897923	688217	
860270	860256	As seasonality increases, the abundance of drought-deciduous trees increases and semi-evergreen rainforests more closely resemble Tropical Dry Forest &amp; Woodland (F013). Tropical monsoon forests are sometimes grouped with Tropical Lowland Humid Forest as "tropical moist forest" (Whitmore 1998), but they are here included with Tropical Dry Forest &amp; Woodland.
860245	860255	Open woodlands or tree savannas, with grassy or shrubby understories, and with trees 10% cover or more, are placed here, but may have strong floristic similarities to grasslands.
860245	860241	Open woodlands or tree savannas, with grassy or shrubby understories, and with trees 10% cover or more, are placed here, but may have strong floristic similarities to grasslands.
860266	860245	This type is currently separated based on geography and climate.
860238	860259	The strength of the tropical versus temperate distinction may be weak in these coastal habits, but perennial herbs may be more common in tropical beaches.
860238	860245	There are similarities between coastal and inland dunes in terms of growth forms and even wind-driven processes.
860253	860245	Upland transitions to wet-mesic or moist grasslands, such as wet-mesic prairies, can be hard to place.
860253	860268	Fens and marshes can be similar, especially when fen peat mats are inundated (as with "shore fens").
860253	860237	This type includes forested bogs with &gt;10% cover along with poor swamps.
860268	860253	Fens and marshes can be similar, especially when fen peat mats are inundated (as with "shore fens").
860268	860269	Inland salt marshes are non-tidal, but saline (or haline) and may resemble some brackish freshwater marshes.
860219	860232	Where tree cover exceeds 10%, stands are typically placed in <i>1.A. ~Tropical Forest &amp; Woodland Subclass (S17)$$</i>. However, in tropical upland savanna regions, stands more typically exceed 40% tree cover, trees are &gt;8 m tall, tree regeneration is abundant, and there is no substantial graminoid layer.
860246	860258	This type is often treated broadly to include both tropical montane and high montane vegetation, i.e., all vegetation near or above the tropical treeline (e.g., Quinn 2008).
860254	860258	Many authors would place what is described in Tropical Montane Shrubland, Grassland &amp; Savanna with this formation (e.g., Quinn 2008).
860259	860246	Found in non-coastal habitats.
860259	860238	The strength of the tropical versus temperate distinction may be weak in these coastal habits, but annual or ephemeral herbs may be more common in temperate beaches.

860270	860265	Thorn woodlands, with xeromorphic characteristics (aphyllous or very small-leaved trees, with succulents) are placed in this xeromorphic woodland formation (F039). Rainfall is between 25 and 100 cm. Tropical Dry Forest &amp; Woodland grades to Tropical Thorn Woodland in areas with lower annual rainfall and increasing period of seasonal drought (in xeric warm bioclimates), while the trees and shrubs become fully deciduous and with a considerable increase of distinct xeromorphic adaptations such as thorns, succulency and clearly microphyllous species that instead are scarce or absent in Tropical Dry Forest &amp; Woodland.
860224	860232	1.A. ~Tropical Forest &amp; Woodland Subclass (S17)$$</i> in drier climates may have small-leaved sclerophyllous evergreen trees or deciduous trees that can be similar to trees found in thorn woodland in warm deserts. Thorn woodlands are sometimes included as part of Tropical Forest.
860265	860252	
860216	860218	This class is restricted to open rock vegetation where nonvascular vegetation is at least 10% and where vascular plants, if present, are mesomorphic.
860216	860213	In montane deserts, there may be a transition from cool semi-desert to alpine that may be difficult to distinguish.
860216	860211	Desert grasslands typically include xeromorphic shrubs and trees, which place them in the Xeromorphic class. Environmental drivers and stressors can cause desert grasslands to cross thresholds into desert scrub. They may also cause dry mesomorphic grasslands with small-leaved shrubs to appear similar to xeromorphic grasslands (e.g., shortgrass prairie in the North American Great Plains).
860211	860216	Desert grassland growth forms currently are not distinguished from temperate (mesomorphic) grasslands, and, where these grasslands lack xeromorphic shrubs, there may be no growth forms that provide xeromorphic criteria. In addition, the transition from dry temperate grassland to cool or warm semi-desert may be challenging, and rely more on floristics than growth forms. Desert grasslands lacking many xeromorphic associates in the sense of those in the southwestern United States (New Mexico, Texas, or Arizona) may be considered monsoonal and, thus, could be considered mesomorphic grasslands. Further review is needed.
860215	860217	Where mesomorphic tree growth forms are &gt;10% in canopy, and are irregular in structure in the understory (i.e., natural processes occur for tree saplings, seedlings, herbs and shrubs), stands may better fit here (e.g., tree plantations where the ground layer is not managed or eliminated).
860215	860211	Where mesomorphic shrub and herb growth forms are irregular in structure (i.e., natural processes occur for tree seedlings, herbs and shrubs), stands may better fit here (e.g., pastures where non-intensive grazing of livestock on native or introduced grasslands).
860215	860214	Farm and urban ponds that are not regularly managed may contain a native set of growth forms and species that place them in this class.

The southeastern tree species <i>Quercus muehlenbergii, Prunus serotina, Ulmus crassifolia, Quercus stellata, Quercus marilandica, Aesculus pavia, Lindera benzoin</i>, and <i>Cercis canadensis</i> may be shared between the divisions. In addition to the diagnostic Balconian species, species with western affiliations such as <i>Acer grandidentatum, Diospyros texana, Quercus mohriana, Juglans major</i>, and <i>Prosopis glandulosa</i> generally will also indicate D060.

860374	885014	abuts this division (D026) in southern Florida and, possibly, along the south Texas Gulf Coast. The two divisions share species such as <i>Batis maritima, Cakile lanceolata, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Sporobolus virginicus</i>, and <i>Uniola paniculata</i>. The former division is distinguished by a predominance of characteristically tropical species, including <i>Alternanthera maritima, Blutaparon vermiculare (= Philoxerus vermicularis), Canavalia rosea, Chamaesyce mesembrianthemifolia (= Euphorbia mesembrianthemifolia), Coccoloba uvifera, Ipomoea pes-caprae, Piscidia piscipula, Pithecellobium keyense, Remirea maritima, Scaevola plumieri</i>, and <i>Suriana maritima</i>.
860374	860301	occurs to the north of D026, and the two units share a number of species found in the northern areas of the latter division. Diagnostic criteria for the eastern part of the former division are currently not clear; the boundary between these divisions is in Canada.
860374	860295	interfaces inland along its entire range with this division. Vegetation of D024 lacks the species assemblages that are unique to the maritime setting, including its exposure to frequent storm disturbance. Some inland sites may be on sandy, rapidly drained sites that have broad floristic similarity to D026, but these stands can be distinguished by the usual absence of species that are strictly or primarily coastal in distribution [see Diagnostic Characteristics].
860374	860351	interfaces inland along its entire range with this division. Vegetation of D0102 lacks the species assemblages that are unique to the maritime setting, including its exposure to frequent storm disturbance. Some inland sites may be on sandy, rapidly drained sites that have broad floristic similarity to D026, but these stands can be distinguished by the usual absence of species that are strictly or primarily coastal in distribution [see Diagnostic Characteristics].
860374	860325	Sparsely vegetated upper beach stands of D026 intergrade with sparser (incipient) stands of D034 in the middle to inland side of barrier islands and spits, and the two units share some salt-tolerant ruderal species. Stands that can be assigned to the salt marsh D034 can be distinguished by a greater prevalence of hydrophytic, rather than upland, species, including pioneer individuals of the eventually dominant graminoid species (e.g., <i>Spartina alterniflora, Distichlis spicata</i>).
860293	860407	intergrades with D064 along a salinity gradient, with D065 occupying salinity regimes of upper mesohaline or higher (approximately greater than 10 practical salinity units (psu)) and D064 in oligohaline to lower mesohaline regimes. Except for <i>Ruppia maritima</i>, there is generally little floristic overlap between the divisions. The presence of <i>Zostera</i> spp. and/or <i>Phyllospadix</i> spp. usually will be diagnostic of D064, while that of <i>Zannichellia palustris, Stuckenia pectinata, Potamogeton</i> spp., and other species that can grow in freshwater will indicate D065. Because of the wide salinity tolerance of <i>Ruppia maritima</i>, stands strongly dominated by that species may be problematic to assign. In these cases, the predominance of these other species as minor associates will often make the determination. Vascular plant stands that are monospecific with <i>Ruppia maritima</i> occur in both divisions and may have to be assigned by water salinity and/or by associated biota other than vascular plants.
860293	860303	intergrades with D064 along a climate gradient in the southeastern Atlantic coast, with the boundary near the southern limit of the range of <i>Zostera marina</i> (approximately the North Carolina - South Carolina border). As with the conceptual boundary with D065, <i>Ruppia maritima</i> is characteristic of both divisions. In mixed stands near this boundary, the presence of <i>Zostera marina</i> indicates D063, while monospecific stands of <i>Halodule wrightii</i> or stands with both <i>Halodule wrightii</i> and <i>Ruppia maritima</i>, but without <i>Zostera marina</i>, generally will be assigned D064. Other taxa that are characteristic of D063 in the southeastern United States (<i>Halophila</i> spp., <i>Cymodocea filiformis (= Syringodium filiforme)</i>, and <i>Thalassia testudinum</i>) have ranges that do not overlap that of <i>Zostera marina</i>. On the Pacific coast of North America, the boundary between the two divisions occurs well south of the U.S. (south of Baja California).
872779	872780	includes floodplain and swamp forests over the range of D194.
872779	872761	includes predominately conifer forests and woodlands of temperate maritime (coastal) areas that occur to the west of D194.
872779	860348	includes warmer climate forests, woodlands and savannas dominated by oak and conifer species that occur south and west of D194.
872779	860311	includes warmer climate evergreen, conifer or broad-leaved forests, woodlands or savannas of Madrean species of pinyon, juniper and oak, or conifer-oak mixed forests that occur to the south of D194.
872779	860343	
886897	833254	occurs on warmer and drier sites with <i>Abies concolor</i>, but may have <i>Abies magnifica</i> codominant.
886897	833266	occurs on colder sites, generally further north, where the transition from G749 to this one is to be determined.
860853	959747	is dominated by dwarf rather than erect willow species.
684542	687615	
933578	860387	The range of D323 abuts that of D032 in Texas and New Mexico where the southwestern Great Plains or the Edwards Plateau meet the Chihuahuan Desert region. Generally the predominance of [cold-tolerant] Great Plains species (e.g., <i>Carex emoryi, Elaeagnus angustifolia, Panicum virgatum, Spartina pectinata</i>) and eastern temperate region species (e.g., <i>Justicia americana</i>) will indicate the former, while the predominance of less cold-tolerant] desert species (e.g., <i>Arundo donax, Baccharis salicifolia, Muhlenbergia rigens, Prosopis</i> spp., <i>Pluchea sericea, Tamarix</i> spp.) will indicate the latter.
933578	933574	The range of D323 abuts that D322 in the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains from the Maritime Provinces to Texas. Generally, species that are restricted to the coastal plains (e.g., <i>Amaranthus cannabinus, Carex hyalinolepis, Cladium mariscus ssp. jamaicense, </i><i>Eleocharis equisetoides, Ilex glabra, Leersia hexandra, Morella cerifera, Nelumbo lutea, Panicum hemitomon, Panicum tenerum, Proserpinaca pectinata, Spartina cynosuroides, Vaccinium formosum, Vaccinium fuscatum, Zizaniopsis miliacea</i>) will indicate stands of D322. Genera such as <i>Andropogon, Eriocaulon, Fimbristylis, Fuirena, Paspalum, Rhynchospora, Sarracenia</i>, and <i>Xyris</i> have greater prominence and a higher diversity of species in D322, in the southern part of the ranges of the two divisions. The floristic distinctions between the divisions in the northern part of their ranges, where there are fewer characteristically warm-temperate taxa, is not as clear.
933578	893245	The range of D323 extends to that of D320 in the boreal region of Canada (outside the scope of the USNVC). The two divisions share a number of dominant species (e.g., <i>Calamagrostis canadensis, Carex aquatilis, Carex utriculata</i>), and the floristic distinctions between the divisions within the boreal region are not clear.
933578	860295	Stands of D323 may intergrade with [upland] stands of D024. In many cases, the hydrophytic vegetation criterion of a prevalence index score of 3.0 or less (Wentworth et al. 1988, USACE 2010a, 2010b, 2012a, 2012b) often is a reasonably accurate diagnostic feature for distinguishing vegetation of the former from that of the upland division.
933578	860386	Stands of D323 may intergrade with [upland] stands of D024. In many cases, the hydrophytic vegetation criterion of a prevalence index score of 3.0 or less (Wentworth et al. 1988, USACE 2010a, 2010b, 2012a, 2012b) often is a reasonably accurate diagnostic feature for distinguishing vegetation of the former from the upland division.
933578	860274	Stands of D323 may intergrade with those of D029 in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. The former usually occur on mineral soils or mucky Histosols, whereas the latter are usually on peaty Histosols. In this area, D029 is characterized by the predominance of peatland-favoring vascular species such as <i>Andromeda polifolia, Carex exilis, Carex lasiocarpa, Carex livida, Carex magellanica ssp. irrigua, Carex michauxiana, Carex oligosperma, Carex sterilis, Chamaedaphne calyculata, Dasiphora fruticosa ssp. floribunda, Drosera</i> spp., <i>Eriophorum</i> spp., <i>Kalmia angustifolia, Kalmia polifolia, Ledum groenlandicum, Rhynchospora alba, Sarracenia purpurea, Trichophorum alpinum</i>, and/or <i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>, and of bryophytes such as <i>Aulacomnium palustre, </i><i>Campylium stellatum, Scorpidium scorpioides, Sphagnum capillifolium (= Sphagnum nemoreum), Sphagnum centrale, Sphagnum contortum, Sphagnum cuspidatum, Sphagnum fuscum, Sphagnum magellanicum, Sphagnum papillosum, Sphagnum rubellum, Sphagnum teres, Sphagnum warnstorfii</i>, and/or <i>Tomentypnum nitens</i>.
933578	860350	The range of D323 abuts that of D031 where the eastern foot of the Rocky Mountains meets the western edge of the Great Plains in Alberta, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. Generally, the predominance of Great Plains species (e.g., <i>Artemisia cana ssp. cana, Carex emoryi, Elaeagnus angustifolia, Panicum virgatum, Pascopyrum smithii, Salix interior</i> (in the strict sense), <i>Schoenoplectus pungens, Shepherdia argentea, Spartina pectinata</i>) will indicate the former, while the predominance of montane species (e.g., <i>Alnus incana ssp. tenuifolia, Betula occidentalis, Salix geyeriana, Salix irrorata, Salix monticola</i>) will indicate the latter.
933578	860365	Stands of D323 may intergrade with those of D033 in the Great Plains where saline playas, flats or marshes occur, and stands attributable to the different divisions may share species (e.g., <i>Hordeum jubatum, Pascopyrum smithii, Schoenoplectus pungens</i>). D033 is characterized by the importance of high salinity or alkalinity -species (e.g., <i>Atriplex patula, Distichlis spicata, Muhlenbergia asperifolia, Poa arida, Puccinellia nuttalliana, Salicornia rubra, Sarcobatus vermiculatus, Schoenoplectus americanus, Schoenoplectus maritimus, Sporobolus airoides, Suaeda calceoliformis</i>).

860408	860294	includes salt-tolerant coastal vegetation of the inter-tidal zone (i.e., estuarine vegetation).
872761	872779	includes predominately conifer forests and woodlands of temperate continental climate areas that occur to the east of the D192. To the north, in northern British Columbia, D194 forests are a narrow band between coastal forests of D192 and boreal forests of D014.
872761	860348	includes warmer climate forests, woodlands and savannas dominated by oak and conifer species that occur south of D192.
872761	860385	includes cold, continental climate forests and woodlands that abut D192 in Alaska.
872761	872765	includes floodplain and swamp forests over the range of D192.

881398	866456	has similar ruderal alliances but rather than occurring in cool, semi-arid sites, stands occur in cool, temperate regions and include montane, subalpine and alpine areas. Vegetation lacks obligate wetland species and is not dominated by facultative wetland species.
881398	857308	has similar ruderal alliances but occurs on mesic to wet sites and vegetation either includes obligate wetland species or is dominated by facultative wetland species.
881398	874156	may include similar alliances, but is restricted to lowlands west of the Cascade Range.
881398	860755	may include similar alliances, but is restricted to cool, semi-arid desert regions.

860326	860331	There is overlap with D036 and ~Great Basin Saltbush Scrub Macrogroup (M093)$$ in D040. However, there are generally very few phreatophytic (groundwater-dependent) species present in M093. Certain alliances, such as ~<i>Chrysothamnus albidus</i> Shrubland Alliance (A0834)$$ (currently within M171) are close ecologically to D036, and with further investigation, may be found to best fit there.
860326	860350	Within D040, some of the mesic associations in ~<i>Artemisia cana ssp. bolanderi - Artemisia cana ssp. viscidula</i> Steppe &amp; Shrubland Alliance (A3200)$$, in G304/M169) verge on moist meadow settings that are part of D031.

860348	872761	abuts stands of D007, where the former occupy the middle to higher elevations of montane areas (e.g., the Klamath Mountains, Cascade, Sierra Nevada, Coast, Transverse, and Peninsular ranges). The two divisions also intergrade along a latitudinal gradient at or slightly above sea level elevations along the northern California coast. Species such as <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii, Quercus kelloggii, Quercus garryana</i>, and <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> may be important components of vegetation units within both divisions. Floristically, evergreen broad-leaved (hardwood) tree species and closed-cone conifers are more characteristic of D007, whereas the conifer genera <i>Tsuga, Sequoia, Sequoiadendron, Calocedrus, Chamaecyparis, Thuja, Abies</i>, and <i>Picea</i> and species such as <i>Pinus lambertiana, Pinus jeffreyi</i>, and <i>Acer macrophyllum</i> are more characteristic of D192.
860407	860293	intergrades with D065 along a salinity gradient in coastal estuaries along the North American Pacific coast from Baja California to Alaska and along the North American Atlantic coast from North Carolina to subarctic Canada. The seagrasses in D064 occupy salinity regimes of upper mesohaline or higher (approximately, greater than 10-15 practical salinity units (psu)), whereas D065 occupies oligohaline to middle mesohaline regimes (except in inland and/or hydrologically isolated settings, which may be hypersaline). Except for <i>Ruppia maritima</i>, there is generally little floristic overlap between the divisions. The presence of <i>Zostera</i> spp. usually will be diagnostic of the former, while that of <i>Zannichellia palustris, Stuckenia pectinata, Potamogeton</i> spp., and other species that can grow in freshwater will indicate the latter. Because of the wide salinity tolerance of <i>Ruppia maritima</i>, stands strongly dominated by that species may be problematic to assign. In these cases, the predominance of these other species as minor associates will often make the determination. Vascular plant stands that are monospecific with <i>Ruppia maritima</i> occur in both divisions and may have to be assigned by water salinity and/or by associated biota other than vascular plants.
860407	860303	may intergrade with D065 along a similar salinity gradient in warm-temperate to subtropical regions, and the cosmopolitan <i>Ruppia maritima</i> (including monospecific stands) is an element of both divisions. Within the U.S., the seagrasses of D063 occur along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the southeastern United States from South Carolina to Texas and also in the Caribbean, Hawaii, and other tropical Pacific islands. The predominance of the associates <i>Halophila</i> spp., <i>Halodule</i> spp., <i>Cymodocea filiformis (= Syringodium filiforme)</i>, and/or <i>Thalassia testudinum</i> and the absence of the associates <i>Stuckenia pectinata, Zannichellia palustris, Potamogeton perfoliatus</i>, and/or freshwater species will indicate D063. Vascular plant stands that are monospecific with <i>Ruppia maritima</i> may have to be assigned by water salinity and/or by associated biota other than vascular plants.
860407	860357	The freshwater aquatic D049 intergrades with D065 along a salinity gradient in coastal estuaries, with D049 occupying salinity regimes of freshwater to mildly oligohaline (usually, less than 1 practical salinity unit (psu)) and D065 in oligohaline to middle mesohaline regimes. Taxa such as <i>Stuckenia pectinata, Zannichellia palustris</i>, and <i>Potamogeton perfoliatus</i> are common to both divisions, but the presence of <i>Ruppia</i> spp. usually will be diagnostic of D065, while predominance of more strictly freshwater taxa (e.g., <i>Vallisneria, Myriophyllum, Ceratophyllum, Elodea, Najas, Potamogeton</i> other than <i>Potamogeton perfoliatus, Hydrilla, Heteranthera</i>), over salt-tolerant taxa (e.g., <i>Ruppia</i> spp., <i>Stuckenia pectinata, Zannichellia palustris, Potamogeton perfoliatus</i>) generally will indicate D049.
